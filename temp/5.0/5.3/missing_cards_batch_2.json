    "correct_answer": ["Screen is black after Windows splash screen disappears"],

    "correct_answer": ["To protect the expensive metal halide bulb from overheating damage"],
    "explanation": "Temperature sensors monitor the extreme heat from metal halide bulbs (around 1,000°C) and trigger automatic shutdown if temperatures become dangerous. This prevents costly bulb damage and potential safety hazards from overheating.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": ["Use a multiple of the native resolution for better scaling"],
    "explanation": "If you can't use native resolution, using a multiple (like half or double) provides better scaling results. This allows more predictable pixel mapping and reduces the scaling artifacts that make text and graphics appear fuzzy.",
