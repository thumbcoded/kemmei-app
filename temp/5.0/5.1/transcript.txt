# Hardware Troubleshooting Overview

## Power-On Self-Test (POST)

As you're most likely aware, when you turn on your computer there are a series of tests that take place known as the POST. This stands for Power-On Self-Test. This is a self-test to determine if the core components of your system are installed and if they're operational.

This checks to see if your CPU is installed and operational and if it's able to communicate to your BIOS hardware. This might also check to see if your video subsystem is working properly and if memory is also installed in your computer.

If there are any problems with any of these components, you'll get an error message on the screen if possible, and a series of beeps that come from the motherboard. The beeps and the messages that you might see on the screen might be similar between manufacturers, but very often there are differences between one manufacturer's BIOS and another. This means that a series of beeps on one motherboard might mean something completely different on another motherboard.

For that reason, you shouldn't bother memorizing specific beep codes for an individual manufacturer because when this happens, you'll probably be referencing the documentation anyway. Since all of these different manufacturers are using different beep codes on different motherboards, it's probably a good idea to check with the documentation anyway.

The real key is understanding what that beep code means and what you should do next. If you are getting beep codes, there should be messages on the screen if there's no problems with your video display, and certainly there will be a series of codes (probably long and short codes) that you'll need to reference. You'll need to look at the error codes on your screen and reference how many beeps you're hearing in this beep code against the manufacturer's documentation. That's going to tell you what part of this BIOS failed and hopefully point you in a direction for resolving this hardware problem.

## Common POST Issues

### No Video Display with Beeps

If you turn on your computer and start hearing beeping noises but you see nothing on the screen, then your problem is probably related to bad video on the motherboard, although it could be related to bad memory or a bad CPU. If any of those components aren't working, then you probably have no way to present any data on your screen and therefore the screen remains black. This could also be a misconfiguration with the video subsystem inside your BIOS, so you'll want to look at the BIOS configuration and confirm that everything in the BIOS looks to be in order.

### Incorrect Date and Time

If you're powering up and you get a message that the BIOS time and date is incorrect, then it's very possible your problem is with the battery that's on the motherboard. One of the few reasons we still have a battery on the motherboard is to maintain the date and time, especially if there's no power source to the computer. This means we could move the computer, plug it back into a power source, and the computer already knows the date and time based on that clock that's keeping that updated when you're not connected to power.

If your battery has failed, you'll be prompted to input the date and the time each time you plug in that computer and start it back up again. Simply replacing the battery on the motherboard will resolve this problem. You can put in the correct date and time and you'll no longer be prompted each time you turn on your computer.

### Boot Order Issues

You may find when you start your computer that it tries to start an operating system from a USB key that you installed into the computer. This may not be the boot process you would like to have in place when the computer starts, so you might want to look at your BIOS and see what the boot order happens to be. For example, you may be able to set the USB connection at a lower priority than your internal SSD to ensure that SSD drive is always referenced first during the boot process.

You'll obviously need a valid operating system on whatever device you decide to boot from, so if it's an SSD or a flash drive, you'll need an operating system so that you can start from those individual storage devices. Your BIOS might give you the option to check that there is actually media plugged into that particular startup device. If there's nothing physically connected to those USB interfaces, then your BIOS will decide to go to the next device on its list of boot devices.

## Windows Stop Errors (Blue Screen of Death)

When you're working on your computer, it's important to know what to do next when you run into a problem, because your issues might be bigger than you were expecting. Whenever you see an error like this, you know that the entire system has come to a stop. It might tell you that your device ran into a problem and now needs to restart. It also says it's collecting some error info, and then the system in many cases will automatically restart for you.

This message is referred to as a Windows stop error, and it's the kind of message you see when the operating system is not able to recover from some type of issue. Sometimes you'll see people refer to this as the Blue Screen of Death because if you see this message, you will need to restart your computer, and if you haven't saved any of your work, you may lose everything that you've been working on.

This message is telling you there's been an irrecoverable error in the operating system and the system had to be stopped before something really bad happened. This is Windows attempting to maintain the integrity of your operating system and all of the data that's on it. If you start seeing these messages, then there's something that's going very wrong on your system and you may want to continue troubleshooting what could be causing these stop errors to occur.

## Hardware-Specific Troubleshooting Symptoms

Let's dive a little deeper into some specific hardware issues and see what the symptoms are for each one.

### Hard Drive/SSD Problems

If you're having problems with your hard drive or SSD, then you might see messages like "cannot read from the source disc" or you might see very slow performance when reading or writing to that drive. With hard drives, you may even hear loud clicking noises that indicate the disk is constantly trying to retry reads or writes to that storage device.

### Memory Problems

If you're having memory problems, you may see application crashes, blue screens of death, or parity errors being displayed on your screen.

### CPU Problems

CPU problems might show themselves as lock-ups during intensive processing, or if your CPU is overheating, you may see spontaneous reboots or blue screens as the system tries to protect itself from damage.

### Power Supply Problems

Power problems can show up as intermittent problems where the system might power on and then immediately power off, or you may find that your system powers on but nothing happensâ€”no fans are spinning, no lights are coming on, and obviously no video is appearing on the screen.

### Video Card Problems

If there are hardware problems with your video card, you may see blue screens, artifacts on your display, or your entire system might lock up when you're performing any graphics-intensive processes like playing games or watching video.

### Motherboard Problems

Motherboard problems can show up as a lot of different symptoms. The motherboard is the one thing that connects all of the other components together, so any problems with the motherboard can show up as problems with any of the other components that are connected to it. You may see intermittent operation where sometimes things work and sometimes they don't, or you may find that certain expansion slots or certain connectors on your motherboard are simply not operational at all.

## Troubleshooting Process: No Power/No Display

Let's look at a specific troubleshooting process for when you turn on a computer and nothing appears on your screen and you don't hear any beeps. This is a common issue and usually tells us that we either have a bad power supply or a bad motherboard, but it could be related to any number of different problems.

### Step 1: Check Basic Power

Our first step when we see this is to check if the computer is plugged in and see if the power switch is actually turned on. This may sound very basic, but it's amazing how often somebody has forgotten to plug in their computer or they plugged it into a power strip that is currently turned off.

Sometimes there are two power switches. You may have a power switch on the back of the computer near the power supply and then there's the normal power switch on the front. If that back power switch is in the off position, then the front power switch will not work.

### Step 2: Check for Power Indicators

Once you confirm the power is working, the next thing to check is if there are any lights on the power supply or on the motherboard. Most power supplies have an LED that is on whenever the power supply has power, even if the computer is turned off. So if that LED light is on, you know that the power supply is getting at least some power.

If there's no LED on the power supply, you might want to check the motherboard to see if there are any LED lights there. If you don't see any lights at all on the system, it's very likely that the power supply has failed or perhaps the motherboard is not receiving any power from the power supply.

### Step 3: Check Internal Connections

If you do see lights when the system is powered on but you're not hearing any fans or there's no video on the display, then you might want to make sure that all of the internal power cables are connected properly. Check that the motherboard power is connected, check that the CPU power is connected, and make sure all of the device power is connected as well.

### Step 4: Minimum Component Testing

If you still don't see any video on the screen, it's time to start removing components and try to narrow down which part of the system may be causing the problem. Start by removing all of the expansion cards and peripherals that you can. Remember, you want to boot the system with the minimum number of components required. Start with just your motherboard, CPU, one stick of memory, and see if the system will at least try to boot.

If it does, then you can add one component at a time to see which one is causing the problem. If the system still doesn't boot with the minimum number of components, then you may have a bad CPU, bad memory, or a bad motherboard. Try putting a different memory stick in to see if that resolves the issue. If you have a way to try a different CPU, then certainly do that as well. Of course, if the motherboard is the problem, you'll need to replace the entire motherboard, which unfortunately means removing many of the other components and reinstalling them into the new motherboard.

## CPU Troubleshooting

CPU problems can be particularly challenging because our modern CPUs operate at very high speeds and therefore they get very hot. To cool these CPUs down, we commonly have a cooling fan and a heat sink that are connected directly to the top of the CPU. If for any reason that cooling process is not working, then the CPU will get very hot very quickly.

### Thermal Protection

The CPU is designed with thermal protections, and if the CPU gets too hot, it will either throttle down the clock speed so it's running much more slowly, or if it continues to get hotter, the entire system will suddenly power off. This is the CPU protecting itself from permanent damage due to heat.

### Cooling System Check

If your CPU is overheating and shutting down the system, you want to confirm that the cooling fan is working properly and that there's good airflow through your computer case. Check to see that the heat sink is properly connected to the CPU, that there is thermal paste between the CPU and the heat sink, and that the heat sink is not blocked with dust or other debris. You should also check the temperature monitoring software to see what temperatures you're getting for that CPU under normal load.

### CPU Seating Issues

You may also find that the CPU is not properly seated in the motherboard socket. This might show up as the system powering on but then getting a blue screen of death or having the system lock up randomly during operation. Once you've removed the CPU, you can visually check both the CPU and the motherboard socket to confirm that all of the connectors are straight and there are no bent pins.

With modern Intel processors, the pins are in the motherboard socket. With AMD processors, the pins are on the CPU itself. In either case, if any of those pins are bent, it can cause intermittent problems or the CPU to not work at all. There are techniques to straighten bent pins, but this is a delicate process and very often if the pins are bent, the safest option is to simply replace that CPU or the motherboard if the pins happen to be on the motherboard socket.

## Memory Troubleshooting

One of the most important components in our computers is the memory because that's where all of our applications and our data is temporarily stored. If there are problems with the memory, you might see very random issues when you're using your computer.

### Memory Problem Symptoms

You might find that applications crash randomly, that there might be blue screens of death that occur at seemingly random times, or you might see parity errors on your screen. Another symptom of bad memory is that your system memory is not adding up to the amount of memory that you have installed. For example, if you have installed 16 gigabytes of RAM but your system is only showing 12 gigabytes, then you either have a piece of memory that's not working or not installed properly, or there might be a problem with the memory slot that's on your motherboard.

### Memory Diagnostic Tools

Fortunately, there are memory diagnostic utilities that can check your memory extensively and they can tell you if any of the memory that's in your system has any problems.

#### Windows Memory Diagnostic

One is the Windows Memory Diagnostic that's built into Windows. If you have problems with your memory, this diagnostic will restart your computer and run a series of memory tests. If there are problems found with your memory, it will give you a message after the computer reboots.

#### MemTest86

If your Windows Memory Diagnostic doesn't find any problems but you're still having intermittent memory issues, you may want to try a third-party memory testing utility. MemTest86 is one that is very popular for this. The nice thing about MemTest86 is that it runs independent of any operating system, which means it can test 100% of the memory that's in your system. This application runs from a bootable USB drive or a bootable optical disc and it will spend as much time as you would like testing every aspect of the memory to make sure that the memory is working properly.

### Memory Module Replacement

If you run the memory test and you do find that you have a memory issue, you'll need to determine which piece of memory is having the problem. If you have multiple memory modules, try removing one module at a time and running the memory test again. Once you've isolated which module is having the problem, you can replace that individual memory module and the rest of the memory in your system should continue to work normally.

You should also check the motherboard documentation to see if there are any specific memory configurations that are recommended for your particular motherboard. For example, some motherboards might require that you populate memory slots in a particular order, or you may only be able to use certain types of memory modules that are specifically designed for your system.

## Power Supply Troubleshooting

Your computer's power supply must provide the right voltage to all of the components that are in your computer. Although our power supplies are generally very reliable, there can be situations where certain voltages may not be correct, and that might cause problems with the components that are using those voltages.

### Power Supply Problem Symptoms

If you're having problems with your power supply, you might see the system not powering on at all, it might power on and then immediately power back off, or you might have intermittent problems where the system randomly powers off and then powers back on. You might also have messages from the motherboard or from software that tells you that the power supply voltages are not within normal tolerances. Some systems will automatically shut down if the power supply voltages are outside of those normal tolerances to prevent any damage to the system components.

### Power Supply Testing

One way to check the power supply is to see if the power supply fan is working. This is commonly visible from the back of the computer. If that fan is not spinning, you may have a power supply that is not working. You might also check to see if there is an LED on the power supply or the motherboard that would indicate the power supply is providing at least some electricity to the system.

### Voltage Testing

If you have a multimeter, you can also check the voltages that are being provided by the power supply. This obviously requires that you're comfortable working inside the computer and you understand how to safely use a multimeter around these voltages. The motherboard power connection usually carries a number of different voltages, and you can measure those voltages to see if they're within normal tolerances.

Most motherboards expect to see 12 volts, 5 volts, and 3.3 volts from the power supply. It's also very common to have separate power connections for the CPU, and those usually run at 12 volts as well. If any of these voltages are significantly outside of normal ranges, it could cause stability problems in your system.

## Motherboard Troubleshooting

Our modern motherboards are very complicated with many different components and subsystems all working together. Unfortunately, if any part of the motherboard has a problem, it can affect the rest of the system. This means that motherboard problems can show up as many different types of issues.

### Motherboard Problem Symptoms

You might have expansion slots that don't work, you might have USB ports or other connectors that are not operational, or you might see very intermittent problems where things work sometimes and they don't work other times. This is why troubleshooting motherboard problems can be so challenging.

### Process of Elimination

Sometimes the only way to know if the motherboard is the problem is through a process of elimination. We would swap out the CPU, try different memory, replace the power supply, and ultimately if none of those things resolve the issue, then it's probably the motherboard that's causing the problem.

### Motherboard Replacement

The other challenge with motherboard problems is that replacing the motherboard is a significant undertaking. You effectively need to remove every component from the motherboard and then reinstall all of those components into a brand new motherboard. If you have a warranty on your computer, then it would probably be worthwhile to have the manufacturer replace that motherboard instead of doing it yourself.

## Video Problems

If you've ever worked with a computer that had video problems, you know that the symptoms can be quite dramatic. You might see artifacts on your screen, incorrect colors, or your screen might be flickering or distorted. You might also have your system lock up completely when you're trying to perform graphics-intensive tasks like gaming or watching high-definition video. Another common symptom of video problems is to see a blue screen of death, especially when you're in the middle of using a graphics-intensive application.

### Video Driver Updates

If you're having any of these video problems, the first thing you should do is make sure that your video drivers are up to date. Video drivers are updated very frequently, and it's very common to have video problems that are resolved simply by upgrading to the latest version of your video driver.

### Temperature Monitoring

If updating your video drivers doesn't resolve the problem, then you might want to check the temperature of your video card. Modern graphics cards can get very hot, especially if you're doing graphics-intensive work. You want to make sure that the cooling fan on the graphics card is working and that the heat sink is not blocked with dust or other debris. If the graphics card continues to overheat, it will either throttle down the graphics performance or the entire system may blue screen and restart to protect the graphics card from permanent damage.

### Hardware Testing

If the graphics problems persist, you may want to try moving the graphics card to a different expansion slot on your motherboard to see if the problem is with the slot itself or with the graphics card. Alternatively, you could try a known good graphics card in that same slot to determine if the problem is with the slot or the card.

## No Display Troubleshooting

Sometimes you'll power on your system and nothing will appear on the screen, even though you can hear the fans running and it seems like the computer has power. This could be a display problem, a graphics card problem, or a motherboard problem, and the process for troubleshooting this is very similar to our other troubleshooting processes.

### Connection Check

The first thing to check is that all of the cables are connected properly. Check the power cable for the monitor and check the video cable connection between your computer and the monitor. It's also important to check if your monitor has multiple input types. If it has HDMI, VGA, DVI, and DisplayPort inputs, you want to make sure that you have the input selector on the monitor set to match the type of cable that you're using.

### Monitor Testing

If all of the cables are connected and the monitor input is set correctly and you're still not seeing any video, you may want to try the computer with a different monitor or try moving your monitor to a different computer to see if the problem is with the monitor or with the computer itself. If the problem is with the computer, then you'll want to continue troubleshooting the graphics card, the motherboard, and other components using our normal hardware troubleshooting process.

## Storage Space Issues

I mentioned earlier that one very specific problem you might have with computers is running out of storage space, and this is a problem that can affect the performance of your entire computer. When your storage space is very low, the operating system doesn't have room to store temporary files or expand memory if it needs to.

### Storage Problem Symptoms

You might see messages telling you that the disk is full, or you might see very slow performance, especially when you're trying to save files or load large applications.

### Storage Solutions

The obvious solution to this problem is to free up some disk space, and there are a number of ways to do this. You could delete files that you no longer need, you could uninstall applications that you're not using, or you could move files to external storage or to cloud storage.

Windows includes a disk cleanup utility that can help you identify temporary files that can be safely deleted, and there are also third-party utilities that can help you identify large files that might be taking up unnecessary space on your system.

If freeing up disk space doesn't solve your performance problems, then you might want to consider upgrading to a larger storage device. This could be a larger hard drive or SSD, and modern storage devices have much more capacity than older devices, so you should be able to find something that will meet your storage needs for the foreseeable future.

## System Freezes and Hangs

Another hardware problem we commonly see is when the computer becomes unresponsive and it appears to lock up completely. You can't move the mouse cursor, the keyboard doesn't respond, and nothing seems to work. This is often called a system freeze or a system hang, and it can be caused by many different issues.

### Frequency Assessment

If this happens very rarely, then it might just be a temporary software problem and you can simply restart the computer to resolve the issue. But if it's happening frequently, then there's probably a hardware problem that needs to be resolved.

### Common Causes

Common causes of system freezes include CPU overheating, bad memory, faulty hard drives, or power supply problems. To troubleshoot a system freeze, you'll want to use the same process that we've been discussing: check the temperatures, make sure the cooling is working properly, run memory tests, and check the power supply voltages.

### Event Viewer Analysis

You might also want to check the Event Viewer in Windows to see if there are any error messages that might give you a clue about what's causing the system to freeze. If you can't identify a specific hardware component that's causing the problem, you might want to boot the computer from external media like a USB drive or optical disc to see if the problem persists. If the computer works normally when booting from external media, then the problem is probably with your internal storage device or the operating system itself.

## Performance Issues

One issue that can be particularly frustrating is when the computer is very slow to respond. This might show up as applications taking a very long time to load, the operating system taking a long time to start up, or just general sluggish performance when you're using the computer. There are many potential causes for this issue, and it can be hardware-related or software-related.

### Memory Check

If you're having performance issues, the first thing to check is if the computer is running out of memory. You can use the Task Manager in Windows to see how much memory is being used and how much is available. If you're using most or all of your available memory, then adding more memory might improve the performance significantly.

### Storage Space Check

You should also check the hard drive space as we discussed earlier. If the hard drive is nearly full, it can significantly slow down the system.

### CPU Utilization Check

Another thing to check is the CPU utilization. Again, you can use the Task Manager to see which processes are using the most CPU resources. If you see that the CPU is consistently running at high utilization, there might be a process that's not working properly, or you might need a faster CPU for the work that you're doing.

### Malware Scanning

You should also check for any malware or viruses on the system. Malware can significantly slow down a computer, and it's not always obvious that malware is present. Run a full system scan with your antivirus software and consider using additional malware scanning tools to make sure your system is clean.

### Driver and Software Issues

Finally, you might want to check if there are any driver issues or software conflicts that could be causing performance problems. Outdated drivers or incompatible software can cause significant performance issues, and updating drivers or uninstalling problematic software might resolve the performance issues that you're seeing.

## Battery Replacement

Sometimes the solutions to our hardware problems require that we replace the hardware. We talked earlier about starting your computer and having it prompt for a date and time. That's because the battery that's on your motherboard has failed and you'll need to replace that battery so your system can properly maintain the date and the time.

### Battery Characteristics

These are usually button-style batteries. They have a very low profile on your motherboard so they don't take up a lot of room. They are usually very easy to remove and replace, and you can generally find these at most stores.

### BIOS Configuration Impact

If you have an older computer, you may find that removing this battery completely resets your BIOS configuration. On most modern computers, however, removing this battery will not change any of the configurations of your BIOS, including any passwords that have been set in the BIOS. If you need to remove or completely reset your BIOS settings, then you'll probably need to use a jumper to be able to do that rather than removing this battery.
