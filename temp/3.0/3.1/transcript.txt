Many of the monitors that we use today are LCD monitors. This stands for liquid crystal display. This is a display that has liquid crystals that a light is shown through from the back. It passes through a color filter and then finally to our eyes. This combination of light, filters, and color is how we're able to see information on these displays. 

Prior to LCD technology, we were mostly using large glass display tubes to show information. LCDs provide significant advantages. One of the advantages is that these displays are relatively light. We can put them almost anywhere, hang them on a wall, or make them part of a portable system. They are also relatively low power, making them perfect for mobile devices that run on battery power. Additionally, they are relatively inexpensive, which means we can use them for practically anything where we might need some type of visual feedback.

Because we're shining a light through polarization filters and color filters, it's somewhat difficult to get a true black color from a liquid crystal display. These displays also require a backlight for us to see the information through those polarizing and color filters. Without that light, you have a very dim screen that is difficult to read. That’s why the backlight is so important. On older LCDs, you may see fluorescent lights being used for the backlight, but most modern LCDs use LED lights or light-emitting diodes to produce that light. These lights can also be somewhat difficult to replace. On larger LCDs, you may be able to replace a portion of the backlight, but on smaller, less expensive systems, you may require a complete replacement of the display.

There are also different technologies used with liquid crystal displays. One of these is a TN version of an LCD. TN stands for twisted pneumatic. This was one of the very first types of LCDs introduced, and it provides very fast response times, making it perfect for gaming or fast-moving information on the screen. However, if you move off-center from the display, you’ll notice the color will shift as you move farther off-angle. For situations where multiple people need to view the display, a twisted pneumatic LCD may not be the best choice.

A newer style of LCD is the IPS or in-plane switching LCD. This provides very good color representation, making it ideal for graphics or video editing. However, these can be more expensive than twisted pneumatic LCDs, so you may pay a premium for the excellent color representation. Somewhere in the middle between twisted pneumatic and in-plane switching LCDs is the VA or vertical alignment LCD. This also has very good color representation, although its response time is not as good as a twisted pneumatic display. Depending on the device you’re purchasing or using, there may only be one style of LCD available for that platform. If you have the option to choose between different types of LCDs, you might want to see what options are available and choose the one that’s right for your purposes.

Having a backlight in the display adds to the cost, power draw, and overall size of the display itself. But what if you could get rid of the backlight altogether? One style of display that has no backlight is an OLED or organic light-emitting diode. This type of display contains an organic compound that, when powered, creates and emits light. This means you can have a high-quality, high-definition display without any backlights. OLED displays are much thinner and lighter because there’s no backlight component behind the screen. OLED displays are common in mobile devices like phones, watches, and tablets, but they are also available in larger displays. Because there’s no backlight, OLED displays provide excellent color representation, making them ideal for graphics, images, or video work.

The industry is constantly working to find the best price point for OLEDs versus LCDs. One innovation on the LCD side is the mini LED backlight. This is similar to a traditional LED backlight, but the LEDs are much smaller. Mini LED displays provide control of each individual light in the backlight, allowing the display to adjust which sections of the screen are lit and the intensity of the light. This means darker images or black screens can turn off those LEDs to create deep, dark blacks. Mini LEDs bring LCDs closer to the color representation of OLED displays. If you were to remove the screen and look at the backlight, you’d see a big difference between conventional LEDs and mini LEDs. Mini LEDs provide more granular control of the backlights, resulting in a more nuanced display.

On many devices like watches, phones, tablets, and some laptops, we have the ability to touch the screen to provide input. This uses a digitizer to detect where the screen is touched and converts that touch into coordinates. This allows us to eliminate keyboards and use the screen as the input. However, many devices still offer physical keyboards as an option. This gives users flexibility to choose the right input method for their tasks. Some tasks may require a keyboard, while others are easier with touch input. Many digitizers can recognize both finger touches and stylus input. A stylus works like a pen or pencil, allowing users to touch the screen and have those touches converted into digital form. This is common for tablets but is also used on laptops and desktop computers.

If you have a liquid crystal display, you also have a backlight. Backlights can be fluorescent lamps or newer LED lamps. Fluorescent backlights require alternating current (AC), while laptops typically use direct current (DC). To power fluorescent backlights, an inverter is used to convert DC to AC. If the backlight isn’t working, you can check by shining a flashlight at the screen. If you can faintly see text or graphics, the backlight may need to be replaced. For fluorescent backlights, the inverters may also need replacement. These inverters are often located in the bezel of the display. You can check with the manufacturer to determine the type of backlight and the process for replacement.

When choosing a display, technical specifications vary widely. Consider how the display will be used—whether for gaming, video presentations, or general use. One important specification is pixel density, which measures how many pixels are contained within an inch of the display. Higher pixel density results in a crisper, clearer display. For example, a 27-inch 4K display has a pixel density of 160 pixels per inch, while a 65-inch 4K display has a pixel density of 67 pixels per inch. Although both displays have the same resolution, the smaller display appears sharper due to the higher pixel density.

Another important specification is refresh rate, measured in hertz (Hz). This indicates how many times the display refreshes per second. For movies, 24 frames per second (FPS) is standard, while gaming or fast-moving content may require 60 FPS or higher. The refresh rate must be supported by the display, video card, and connection type. For example, HDMI 2.1 supports 4K resolution at 144 Hz, while DisplayPort 2.1 supports dual 4K displays at 144 Hz each.

Resolution is another key factor. A 4K display has 3,840 horizontal pixels and 2,160 vertical pixels, resulting in a sharper image compared to an HD display. Aspect ratio, such as 16:9, is also important to consider based on the intended use of the display.

Color gamut refers to the range of colors a display can produce. Standards like sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 define these ranges. Displays with wider color gamuts are better for graphics and video editing. OLED displays typically offer the best color representation, making them ideal for professional use.
