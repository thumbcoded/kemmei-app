many of the monitors that we use today
0:04
are LCD monitors This stands for liquid
0:07
crystal display This is a display that
0:10
has liquid crystals that a light is
0:12
shown through from the back It passes
0:14
through a color filter and then finally
0:16
to our eyes This combination of light
0:19
filters and color is how we're able to
0:22
see information on these displays Prior
0:25
to LCD technology we were mostly using
0:28
large glass display tubes to be able to
0:31
show information So these LCDs provide
0:34
us with some significant advantages One
0:37
of the advantages is that these displays
0:39
are relatively light We can put them
0:41
almost anywhere We can hang them on a
0:43
wall They can be part of a portable
0:45
system and we can effectively take this
0:47
display anywhere These also use
0:50
relatively low power so they're perfect
0:52
for our mobile devices that run on
0:54
battery power and they are relatively
0:57
inexpensive The low cost of these
0:59
displays means we can use them for
1:00
practically anything where we might need
1:03
some type of visual feedback Because
1:06
we're shining a light through
1:07
polarization filters and color filters
1:10
it's somewhat difficult to get a true
1:12
black color from a liquid crystal
1:14
display These displays also require that
1:17
backlight for us to be able to see this
1:19
information through those polarizing
1:21
filters and color filters Without that
1:24
light you have a very dim screen that is
1:26
very difficult to read That's why the
1:28
backlight is so important On older LCDs
1:32
you may see fluorescent lights being
1:33
used for the backlight but most modern
1:35
LCDs will use LED lights or light
1:39
emmitting diodes to produce that light
1:42
These lights can also be somewhat
1:43
difficult to replace On larger LCDs you
1:46
may be able to replace a portion of the
1:49
backlight but on smaller less expensive
1:52
systems you may require a complete
1:54
replacement of the
1:55
display There are also different
1:58
technologies that we use with liquid
2:00
crystal displays One of these is a TN
2:03
version of an LCD The TN stands for
2:06
twisted pneumatic This was one of the
2:08
very first types of LCDs that was
2:10
introduced and it provides very fast
2:12
response time So it's perfect for things
2:14
like gaming or very fastm moving
2:16
information on the screen Unfortunately
2:19
if you move off center from that display
2:21
you'll start to notice that the color
2:23
will shift as you move farther and
2:25
farther off angle So if you have a lot
2:27
of people that need to see that display
2:29
a twisted pneumatic LCD may not be the
2:32
best choice A newer style of LCD is the
2:36
IPS or in plane switching LCD This
2:39
provides very good color representation
2:41
So if you're doing any type of graphics
2:43
or video type editing this might be a
2:46
great display for you But these can be a
2:48
bit more expensive than the twisted
2:50
pneumatic version of the LCD So you may
2:53
be paying a little bit more of a premium
2:55
to be able to provide that excellent
2:57
color
2:58
representation And somewhat in the
3:00
middle between a twisted pneumatic and
3:02
an inplane switching LCD is the VA or
3:06
vertical alignment LCD This also has
3:09
very good color representation although
3:11
its response time is not quite as good
3:13
as a twisted pneumatic display And
3:16
depending on the device that you're
3:17
purchasing or using there may be only
3:20
one style of LCD available for that
3:23
particular platform So if you have the
3:25
option to choose between different types
3:27
of LCD you might want to see what
3:29
options are available and choose the one
3:31
that's right for your
3:33
purposes As you can imagine having a
3:35
backlight in the display adds to the
3:37
cost the power draw and the overall size
3:41
of the display itself But what if you
3:43
could get rid of the backlight
3:44
altogether one style of display that has
3:47
no backlight is an OLED or an organic
3:50
light emmitting diode This type of
3:52
display contains an organic compound
3:55
that when you add power to that compound
3:57
creates and emits light This means that
4:00
you can have a high-quality
4:01
highdefinition display without any
4:03
backlights in the display at all This
4:06
means your display can be much thinner
4:08
and much lighter because there's no
4:10
backlight component behind the screen
4:12
And you may already be using an OLED
4:15
display in some of your mobile devices
4:17
It's very common to find OLED on mobile
4:19
phones watches tablets and other mobile
4:22
devices And of course you could choose
4:25
to get much larger displays in different
4:27
styles including one that might be OLED
4:30
And because there's no backlight you can
4:32
get very good color representation on an
4:34
OLED display So if you're someone who is
4:37
working with graphics images or video
4:39
you might want to consider an OLED
4:41
display
4:43
The industry is constantly battling to
4:46
find the best price point for OLEDs
4:49
versus LCD And one of the innovations on
4:52
the LCD side is to create a backlight
4:55
which provides a much better color
4:57
representation One of the ways that
4:59
they've done this is to create a mini
5:02
LED backlight This is the same backlight
5:04
that you would have in a traditional LCD
5:07
but the size of the LEDs or the light
5:10
emmitting diodes is much smaller on a
5:13
mini LED display These displays also
5:16
provide control of each individual light
5:19
in the backlight So the display can make
5:21
the decision on what section of the
5:24
screen should be lit and what the
5:26
intensity of that light should be This
5:28
means if the image on the screen was a
5:31
darker image or completely black the
5:34
screen itself could turn off those LEDs
5:37
to be able to make that black as deep
5:39
and dark as possible This means that the
5:43
less expensive LEDs can come much closer
5:45
to the color representation that you
5:48
might find in a traditional OLED display
5:51
And if you were to remove the screen and
5:53
look at the backlight on these displays
5:55
you would see there is a big difference
5:57
between the conventional LED and the
5:59
mini LED you can see that the miniLEDD
6:02
provides a much more granular control of
6:05
the back lights and you can get a much
6:07
more nuanced view of the display because
6:10
you have many more lights to choose from
6:13
On our watches our phones our tablets
6:15
and some laptop computers we have the
6:18
ability to touch the screen to provide
6:19
input This uses a digitizer to tell
6:22
where we might be touching the screen
6:24
and it converts that touch into a series
6:26
of coordinates This means we can get rid
6:29
of keyboards completely and simply use
6:31
our screen as the input But of course
6:33
you will still find laptops and other
6:36
mobile devices that give you the option
6:38
to include a physical keyboard as well
6:40
This gives you different options for
6:42
input We can use a mouse a digitizer or
6:45
we can use the keyboard that's built
6:46
into the system This means that we could
6:49
use the right type of input for the task
6:51
that we have at hand Some tasks may
6:53
require a keyboard but sometimes
6:55
touching the screen would be a much
6:57
easier way to provide that input Many of
6:59
these digitizers cannot only recognize a
7:02
finger touching the screen but it could
7:04
also use a stylus to be able to provide
7:06
that input A stylus is very similar to
7:09
using a pen or pencil except you can
7:12
touch the screen and have any of those
7:14
touches converted into a digital form
7:17
using this digitizer This is a very
7:19
common input type for things like a
7:21
tablet but you might also find these
7:23
digitizers used quite a bit on laptops
7:25
or even desktop
7:27
computers As you are now aware if you
7:30
have a liquid crystal display then you
7:32
also have a backlight And those
7:34
backlights could be a fluorescent lamp
7:37
or the newer LED type lamps One of the
7:40
challenges with the backlight is we need
7:42
to provide power That power for an LED
7:45
uses the built-in direct current or DC
7:48
power that we use to power our laptop
7:51
But if we have an older style liquid
7:53
crystal display with the fluorescent
7:55
lamps those style of backlight require
7:58
AC or alternating current Since our
8:01
laptops are using direct current we need
8:03
to invert that current so that it is now
8:06
alternating current and can be used by
8:08
our fluorescent backlights One of the
8:10
ways you can tell if the backlight is
8:12
working or not is you can turn on the
8:14
device and then look at the screen very
8:16
closely It often helps to have a
8:18
flashlight that you can shine directly
8:20
at the screen because that light will
8:22
reflect from the back of the display
8:24
itself If you can make out text or
8:26
graphics on the screen but it's very
8:28
faint then your problem might be with
8:30
your backlight This means that we would
8:33
need to replace the backlight itself or
8:35
in the case of a fluorescent backlight
8:37
we might need to replace the inverters
8:40
that are built into this device These
8:42
are very common on laptop computers and
8:45
you may find that these inverters are in
8:47
the bezel of the display itself You can
8:49
check with the manufacturer of that
8:51
laptop to see what style of backlight is
8:53
in use and if it is a fluorescent light
8:55
You can also check to see where those
8:57
inverters might be and what the process
9:00
might be to swap those out for a new one

if you've been in the market for display
0:04
you'll notice that the technical
0:05
specifications vary widely between
0:08
different displays there are different
0:10
options different specifications and a
0:12
number of different settings that
0:14
differentiate one display from another
0:17
we also have to consider how this
0:19
display might be used are we going to
0:21
use it for gaming will it be used for
0:23
watching video presentations will this
0:25
simply be a display that's hanging on
0:27
the wall in a lobby or will we use this
0:29
display for presentations once we know
0:32
how a display will be used we can then
0:34
reference the technical specifications
0:36
for that display to find exactly the
0:38
right display for that particular use
0:41
one technical specification we may want
0:44
to pay attention to is the pixel density
0:46
this tells us how many pixels are
0:48
contained within 1 in of that display
0:51
area if you're in a different part of
0:53
the world this might be the number of
0:54
pixels per centimeter this allows us to
0:57
put a physical number on the clarity of
1:00
this particular display if you have a
1:02
higher pixel density the display will
1:04
look much more crisp and clear than a
1:07
lower pixel density you also have to
1:09
think about how this image will be used
1:11
is this an image that will always be
1:13
displayed on a screen or will we need to
1:15
print this image out onto a printer if
1:18
so we may want to look at the printer
1:20
specifications and determine if the DPI
1:22
or dots per inch on the printer can
1:25
properly represent the image that we're
1:27
seeing on the screen you can start to
1:30
see the differences in pixel density
1:32
when you start comparing how many pixels
1:34
you can fit into a 1 in x 1 in area if
1:37
it's one pixel per inch then obviously
1:40
we have a single pixel in that square in
1:42
area if it's two pixels per inch you can
1:45
see that it is two pixels across and two
1:48
pixels down four pixels per inch are
1:50
four in each direction and eight pixels
1:53
per inch are obviously eight in each
1:55
direction you can start to see how an
1:57
image on an 8 PPI display would be very
2:00
different than the image displayed on a
2:03
one pixel per inch display if you wanted
2:05
to calculate this you could take the
2:07
number of pixels and you could divide
2:09
that by the number of inches obviously
2:11
if you are in a different part of the
2:13
world then that might not be the same
2:15
measurements but for the United States
2:17
we will use inches in this particular
2:20
example so let's take for example a 27in
2:23
4K display this means the size of the
2:26
display is 27 in if you measure on the
2:28
diagonal if we were to measure the width
2:31
of this 27in display it is approximately
2:34
24 in wide and since we know this is a
2:37
4K display there's a total of
2:40
3,840 pixels on that horizontal display
2:44
if we then do the math of dividing 3840
2:46
by 24 we get a total of 160 pixels per
2:50
inch let's take exactly the same
2:53
resolution of 4K display and now let's
2:56
make the total size of the display a 65
2:59
in display this means that we still have
3:02
3,840 horizontal pixels but the width of
3:05
this television is much larger at 57 in
3:08
if we then divide 3840 by 57 we have a
3:12
total of 67 pixels per inch so although
3:15
the image itself may be at exactly the
3:18
same resolution on a 27in display and a
3:21
65-in display you can see that the
3:23
pixels per inch are very different
3:25
between those two displays
3:28
when we look at a display we're not
3:30
looking at a single image we're looking
3:32
at a series of images that are
3:34
constantly being refreshed on our screen
3:36
every second and you'll notice that a
3:39
number of specifications for these
3:41
displays describe just how many times
3:43
they can refresh this screen in a 1
3:46
second period this is referred to very
3:48
generically as the hertz that are
3:50
supported by this display hertz is the
3:53
generic term for the number of cycles
3:55
per second sometimes you'll hear people
3:58
refer to this as the number of frames
3:59
per second or FPS and you could have
4:02
configured the display so that the
4:05
number of hertz does equal the number of
4:07
frames per second but there's some
4:09
display configurations that may only
4:11
update a portion of the display on every
4:14
cycle per second but let's say for this
4:16
discussion that we have configured this
4:18
display for vertical sync or VSYNC which
4:21
means the hertz happens to equal the
4:24
same number of frames per second now we
4:27
have to think about what we will be
4:29
viewing on this particular display if
4:32
this is a display that will be showing
4:33
movies in the United States then we
4:35
expect that to show 24 frames per second
4:38
if you're watching a television show or
4:40
you're looking at a video online you're
4:42
probably viewing that at 30 frames per
4:45
second and if you're watching something
4:46
at a very high speed maybe a sporting
4:48
event or you're gaming on your system
4:51
then you would expect to have something
4:52
that can support 60 frames per second or
4:55
even higher to be able to visually see
4:58
the difference between a low and high
5:00
number of frames per second I put these
5:02
circles on the screen and I've arranged
5:04
these circles to drop at exactly the
5:07
same rates however they will only be
5:09
updated with the number of frames per
5:11
second shown at the top so it might be
5:13
one frame per second 15 frames per
5:15
second or even 30 frames per second
5:18
let's start these going to see what the
5:20
difference might be and if you're
5:21
watching this on a display that is able
5:23
to give you at least 30 frames per
5:25
second then you'll see there was an
5:27
obvious difference between the one frame
5:29
per second and the 30 frames per second
5:32
let's see it again we'll watch the one
5:34
which is very choppy and that's very
5:36
different than the 30 frames per second
5:38
that's moving at a very smooth rate all
5:41
the way down the screen as we mentioned
5:43
earlier if you're working with content
5:45
that moves very quickly on the screen
5:47
this might be video games or sporting
5:49
events then we need a refresh rate
5:51
that's able to keep up with that speed
5:53
on the screen otherwise the information
5:56
being displayed on the screen will look
5:58
like it is stuttering as it's moving
5:59
across the screen but the display is
6:02
only one part of the overall equation we
6:04
need to be sure that the video card or
6:06
video subsystem can support the refresh
6:09
rates that we need and we also need to
6:11
be sure that the connection type that
6:13
we're using is also able to support
6:15
those same refresh rates for example if
6:17
you're using HDMI the 2.1 version of
6:21
HDMI supports a 4K resolution at a total
6:24
of 144 hertz maximum if you're using
6:28
Display Port Display Port 2.1 supports
6:31
dual 4K displays and both of them can
6:34
run at a maximum of 144 hertz that's why
6:38
it's important if you purchase a display
6:40
that can support 144 hertz you want to
6:43
be sure that your adapter card and the
6:45
type of connection between the two can
6:47
also support that refresh rate
6:50
we talked earlier about a 4K display and
6:53
the type of resolution that you can
6:55
expect with that style of display that
6:57
resolution number is referring to the
6:59
number of pixels on the horizontal and
7:02
vertical of this display for example a
7:04
4K display is 3,840 pixels wide and
7:09
2,160 pixels high the larger number of
7:12
pixels will give us a display that looks
7:14
much sharper so if you're looking at an
7:16
image on a 4K screen that will look much
7:19
sharper than the image that's on the
7:21
same sized HD display and on today's
7:24
market there are certainly standards for
7:26
different resolutions that you will
7:28
commonly find but there are some models
7:30
of displays that deviate from these
7:32
particular standard resolutions and
7:34
might have their own set of resolutions
7:36
this aspect ratio of 16x9 is very common
7:40
across these different standards but of
7:42
course different monitors and displays
7:44
provide different aspect ratios and you
7:46
need to get the one that's appropriate
7:48
for your particular use if you're
7:51
watching this video on a 4K display then
7:53
you'll be able to see the difference
7:55
here between an HD display and a 4K
7:58
display you can see that HD is a width
8:00
of
8:01
1,920 pixels and a height of 1,080
8:04
pixels and 4K is obviously much larger
8:07
at
8:09
3,840 pixels wide by
8:12
2,160 pixels high if we were to look at
8:15
both of these displays of the same size
8:18
you would see that the 4K display does
8:20
look much sharper than the display you
8:22
would get on an HD
8:24
display our human eye is able to view a
8:28
vast range of colors but the displays we
8:30
use don't have the same capability our
8:33
human eye can view a much wider range of
8:35
color than a display can we refer to
8:38
this range of available colors that can
8:40
be seen or can be displayed as a color
8:43
gamut this might be a very important
8:46
consideration when you're trying to
8:47
decide on what type of display you'd
8:49
like to use if you're working a lot with
8:51
graphics or some type of images you
8:54
might want a display that provides the
8:56
largest and widest color gamut possible
8:59
one way that this is measured is using
9:01
this
9:02
CIE1931 color space this color image
9:06
that's in the background is the color
9:07
image that our human eye can view and on
9:10
top of that we represent a number of
9:13
different standards that are also
9:14
applied to the displays that we use for
9:17
example the sRGB standard this stands
9:20
for the standard red green blue is
9:22
represented on this screen with this
9:24
blue triangle a display that says it is
9:27
sRGB compatible is one that can display
9:30
this range of colors we have a similar
9:32
set of standards we can apply from Adobe
9:34
with the Adobe RGB and the International
9:37
Telecommunications Union or ITU also has
9:40
a number of standards that you can use
9:42
when trying to compare the capabilities
9:44
of one display with the capabilities of
9:47
another you'll often find this color
9:50
gamut breakdown in the technical
9:51
specifications of the monitor so I went
9:54
online and found a couple of monitors
9:56
that were very similar to each other
9:57
although a different size and you'll
9:59
notice there is a color gamut option
10:02
within the technical specs this
10:04
particular display presents a 100% Rex
10:08
709 and 100% sRGB and a 98%
10:14
DCIP3 you don't have to know the details
10:16
of those specifications but you can look
10:19
at the percentage to see how closely it
10:21
meets those standards we can also start
10:24
comparing those across different
10:25
displays for example the display here on
10:28
the top can support 100% of the sRGB
10:31
standard if we were to purchase the
10:33
display just underneath you can see that
10:35
its color gamut comes close but it still
10:38
is only 95% of the sRGB standard if you
10:43
were trying to choose between one
10:44
display and the other you would need to
10:46
understand how these displays might be
10:48
used if this was a display that's only
10:50
going to be used for some web surfing
10:52
and providing emails you might be able
10:54
to get away with a 95% sRGB but if this
10:58
device is being used for graphics or
11:00
video editing you might want to use a
11:02
display that better fits that particular
11:05
color gamut standard both of these
11:08
displays are LCD displays that have IPS
11:10
technology in fact the IPS here even
11:13
uses different forms of IPS to get a
11:16
much better level of blacks which is
11:17
probably why they get a much larger
11:19
number of the sRGB standard one way that
11:22
you could get the best possible color
11:24
gamut would be to use an OLED display
11:27
because they tend to have the best color
11:29
representation and you'll often find
11:31
that an OLED provides a much better
11:33
compatibility to these standards than
11:35
any of the traditional liquid crystal
11:37
displays
