a laser printer is an amazing piece of
0:04
technology Take some high voltage
0:06
combine it with some charged ions and
0:08
melt some powdered toner on top of a
0:11
sheet of paper press it all together and
0:13
you get some amazing output from these
0:16
laser printers You can also print very
0:18
quickly with these laser printers making
0:20
them a high-capacity output device One
0:23
challenge with laser printers however is
0:25
they are relatively complex with a lot
0:27
of different moving parts inside of the
0:29
device You also need enough memory and
0:32
CPU inside of one of these devices to be
0:34
able to render the page for the final
0:36
output And if this toner somehow finds
0:38
its way outside of the toner cartridge
0:41
you may have to clean up quite a mess
0:43
inside of your laser printer When we
0:46
mentioned the laser printer is
0:47
relatively complex this is what we're
0:49
referring to There are many different
0:51
parts that make up the entire process
0:53
for printing a single page on a laser
0:56
printer Everything in the laser printer
0:58
focuses on getting information from the
1:00
memory of this device onto a
1:03
photosensitive drum that then transfers
1:05
that image to a piece of paper We start
1:08
by charging this drum with a negative
1:10
charge This is done through a wire known
1:13
as a corona wire or it may be a roller
1:16
that has a negative charge itself Once
1:18
you have this negative charge the laser
1:21
writes the image of what you need to
1:23
print onto the outside of this
1:25
photosensitive drum Every place the
1:28
laser touches gets rid of the negative
1:30
charge You then add to this
1:32
photosensitive drum a negatively charged
1:35
set of toner which is going to stick to
1:38
all of the places that the laser is
1:40
touched Since the rest of the drum is
1:42
negatively charged and the toner is also
1:45
negatively charged those two will not
1:47
stick to each other A piece of paper is
1:49
then passed next to the photosensitive
1:51
drum and all of that toner on the drum
1:53
is transferred to the paper Then the
1:56
paper goes through a fuser that uses
1:58
heat and pressure to permanently affix
2:01
that toner to the page Any toner that
2:04
may still be stuck to the photosensitive
2:06
drum is cleaned off and the process
2:08
starts again
2:10
As you can tell by that diagram the
2:12
toner is important for taking the image
2:14
in memory in that printer and getting
2:17
that represented on the printed page If
2:20
you run low on toner you'll notice that
2:22
the image begins getting lighter and
2:24
lighter on the printed page And of
2:26
course if you run out of toner nothing
2:28
will print on that paper Sometimes that
2:31
photosensitive drum which we refer to as
2:34
the OPC drum or the organic
2:36
photoconductor drum is inside of the
2:39
toner cartridge itself Some printers
2:41
might also separate the OPC drum from
2:44
the toner itself That toner cartridge or
2:47
OPC drum by itself are always shipped in
2:50
a bag that prevents any type of light
2:52
from getting in So you want to be sure
2:54
to keep it in that bag until you're
2:56
ready to install it The toner cartridges
2:58
themselves are relatively modular You
3:01
power down the printer lift up the cover
3:03
of the printer and you can pull out the
3:05
entire cartridge from the system From
3:07
there you can take the new toner
3:09
cartridge remove any of the packing
3:11
strips or any of the packing materials
3:13
place it into the printer and restart
3:15
the
3:16
printer Here's a view of a toner
3:18
cartridge where the protective cover has
3:20
been pulled away from the photosensitive
3:22
drum This is not something you'll want
3:24
to do with your toner cartridge but you
3:26
can see how the drum itself and the
3:28
toner cartridge are integrated together
3:30
Some laser printers replace the toner
3:32
cartridge from the top of the printer Or
3:34
you might have a printer like this one
3:36
where the toner cartridge is pulled out
3:38
from the side And if you have a color
3:40
laser printer you may have multiple
3:42
cartridges all with different colors and
3:44
you'll need to put those in their
3:45
appropriate slot inside of the laser
3:47
printer With all of those moving parts
3:50
inside of a laser printer eventually
3:52
pieces of the printer will begin to wear
3:54
out Fortunately most laser printer
3:56
manufacturers will create a maintenance
3:58
kit which contain all of those important
4:01
parts that tend to wear out over time
4:03
These kits contain feed rollers new
4:06
fuser units and anything else for that
4:08
specific model of printer that needs to
4:10
be occasionally maintained Of course not
4:13
every laser printer is used the same
4:15
amount You might have one laser printer
4:17
that is used constantly during the day
4:19
and you might have another laser printer
4:21
that is rarely used You obviously don't
4:23
need to go through the process of
4:25
maintenance until it's required But how
4:27
would you know when that time might be
4:29
fortunately most laser printers will
4:31
have a page counter So you can remotely
4:34
access that printer to determine how
4:36
many pages have been printed since the
4:38
last maintenance update Most printer
4:40
manufacturers will tell you at which
4:42
point you would need to use this
4:43
maintenance kit based on that page
4:46
counter To install the maintenance kit
4:48
you'll want to power down the printer
4:49
and replace those individual components
4:51
that are included with the maintenance
4:53
kit Fortunately most of these kits are
4:55
relatively modular or can be easily
4:57
swapped out inside of that printer If
5:00
you're working with a laser printer that
5:01
has recently been used make sure you're
5:03
careful when you're working inside of
5:05
the printer not to touch the fuser unit
5:08
Those get very hot during operation and
5:10
it does take time for those to cool down
5:13
Once you're finished installing the
5:14
maintenance kit make sure you reset that
5:16
page counter in the printer so that you
5:18
can now monitor it for the next
5:20
maintenance time
5:22
frame When you replace a toner cartridge
5:25
you may notice that the new toner
5:26
cartridge prints at a different density
5:29
than the older cartridge In that case
5:31
you may want to perform a laser printer
5:33
calibration This will print some test
5:35
pages that allow you to determine if
5:37
you're getting too much toner or too
5:39
little toner on the printed page There
5:42
are usually settings in the
5:43
configuration of the printer that allow
5:45
you to fine-tune how much toner will be
5:47
used during a normal printout This can
5:49
be something that is automated in the
5:51
printer or it may be a manual process
5:53
where you have to evaluate the printed
5:55
page make the change in the printer and
5:57
then print a new test page
6:00
As we mentioned earlier these laser
6:02
printers can get very dirty with the
6:04
paper dust that accumulates inside And
6:06
if you do have a toner spill it can get
6:08
very messy inside of the printer You
6:11
want to be very careful when working
6:12
with toner It is a very fine dust It can
6:15
get into the air very easily So you want
6:17
to make sure you handle it properly Make
6:19
sure you check the manufacturer's
6:20
recommendations for cleaning your laser
6:22
printer And most manufacturers will use
6:25
water or some type of isopropyl alcohol
6:27
or IPA to be able to clean the printer
6:30
You do not want to use any harsh
6:32
chemicals inside of your laser printer
6:34
On the outside most manufacturers
6:36
recommend using a damp cloth usually
6:38
with cold water And if you're working
6:40
inside of the printer to clean out the
6:42
paper dust or the toner you do not want
6:44
to use compressed air which will simply
6:46
put that toner into the air around you
6:49
The best practice is to wipe that dust
6:51
away or to use a type of vacuum cleaner
6:54
that is specifically designed to vacuum
6:56
toner If you do get toner on your skin
6:59
try not to use warm or hot water since
7:01
that could melt the toner and make it
7:03
more difficult to remove Instead use
7:06
cold water to be able to clean that
7:08
toner away from your skin If you're
7:10
cleaning components inside of the
7:12
printer cold water is a good choice And
7:14
many of the rollers inside of the
7:16
printer can be cleaned off using that
7:17
isopropyl alcohol

inkjet or ink dispersion printers can
0:04
create highresolution output in both
0:06
black and white and color The technology
0:09
itself is relatively inexpensive and the
0:11
printers themselves operate relatively
0:13
quietly The output on these inkjet
0:16
printers is also high resolution and
0:18
many people will output graphics and
0:20
photographs using an inkjet printer One
0:23
of the downsides to inkjet however is
0:25
the ink that is used It's relatively
0:27
expensive and it is a proprietary method
0:30
that is specific to the manufacturer of
0:32
the printer This ink also tends to fade
0:35
over time So you may find that an output
0:38
that you create today looks very
0:40
different a year from now And one of the
0:42
ongoing problems with inkjet printers is
0:45
that the type of ink that we use tends
0:47
to clog very easily The industry has a
0:50
number of different ways to address
0:51
these clogging issues and they tend to
0:54
vary between different printer
0:56
manufacturers The process of creating
0:58
output on an inkjet printer is
1:00
relatively straightforward Drops of ink
1:02
are moved from a cartridge onto a piece
1:05
of paper to create the final output
1:07
Normally these cartridges have four
1:10
different colors associated with them
1:12
Usually it's a black a cyan magenta and
1:15
yellow You'll sometimes see this
1:17
referred to as CMYK for cyan magenta
1:20
yellow and the K is for key which is
1:22
black These are often installed in the
1:25
printer as individual cartridges
1:27
although there are some printer models
1:29
where all of these colors are within the
1:31
same cartridge inside the printer Some
1:34
of these inkjet printers will combine
1:36
the ink cartridge with the print head
1:38
itself This is an example of that where
1:40
you have a cartridge containing the ink
1:42
and on the bottom of the cartridge is
1:44
the print head itself This means that
1:47
when you replace the print cartridge
1:49
you're also replacing and getting a
1:50
brand new print head Other inkjet
1:53
printer models may keep these separately
1:55
where there is a separate ink cartridge
1:57
and a separate print head located in
1:59
different parts of the printer Here's a
2:02
closeup of that print head You can see
2:04
that it is a very small print head and
2:06
it is very delicate If you are going to
2:08
clean this print head you have to be
2:10
very careful not to damage that This is
2:13
also a relatively simple piece of
2:15
engineering and it's relatively
2:16
inexpensive which is why many printer
2:18
manufacturers combine both the ink
2:20
cartridge and the print head onto the
2:22
same device That way when you replace
2:25
the ink cartridge you're also getting a
2:27
brand new print head
2:29
You can see that the printer itself can
2:30
be relatively small mostly because this
2:33
is a simple design certainly much
2:35
simpler when you compare it to something
2:37
like a laser printer There are usually
2:39
feed rollers in the front You could see
2:41
the feed rollers here that are right
2:42
above the piece of paper They're
2:44
designed to pull the paper into the
2:46
printer and all the way through past the
2:48
print heads and to the other side Some
2:50
larger inkjet printers can support
2:52
duplex printing where they will print on
2:54
both sides of the page This may be a
2:57
feature built into the printer or it may
2:59
require additional hardware to be
3:00
installed You'll need to check with the
3:02
manufacturer of your printer to see if
3:04
duplex printing is supported Here's a
3:07
closer view of those feed rollers You
3:09
can see that they do get a bit dirty
3:11
over time So if you're having a problem
3:13
pulling that paper into the printer you
3:15
may just need to clean off those feed
3:17
rollers


one of the biggest problems you'll run
0:03
into on an inkjet printer is keeping
0:05
that print head clean there are a number
0:07
of processes used across different
0:09
printers to be able to maintain this and
0:12
you'll want to check with your printer
0:13
manufacturer to see the best practices
0:15
for keeping that print head clean and
0:18
able to work properly for example many
0:20
printers run through an automated
0:22
cleaning process every 24 hours that's
0:25
to wipe off any excess or dried ink
0:27
that's on the print head and keep that
0:29
print head as clean as possible if
0:31
you're getting streaks of color across
0:33
the page it's probably because there's
0:35
some excess ink that is still on the
0:37
print heads many inkjet printers also
0:40
allow you to start this process manually
0:42
so if you use your printer a lot during
0:44
the day you may find that it needs to be
0:46
cleaned more than every 24 hours and if
0:49
you're very careful you may be able to
0:50
remove the print head or the entire
0:52
print cartridge from the printer and
0:54
very carefully clean that print head off
0:57
here's an example of an inkjet print
1:00
head that is accumulated ink over a
1:02
24-hour period and here's the same print
1:05
head after
1:07
cleaning the ink cartridges themselves
1:10
are usually either separate colors or
1:12
combined into a single cartridge you
1:15
usually will find cyan magenta yellow
1:18
and key which is the black color and
1:21
it's usually designated as CM YK here's
1:24
an example of these colors in an inkjet
1:26
printer you can see that the cyan
1:28
magenta and yellow colors are all
1:30
combined in a single cartridge and the
1:33
black color is separate on other
1:35
printers you may find completely
1:36
separate cartridges for the cyan magenta
1:39
and yellow making it very modular to
1:42
replace these are usually very quick and
1:44
easy to replace they pop right out of
1:46
their holder inside of the printer and
1:48
you can replace the new one in just a
1:50
few seconds once you add a new cartridge
1:53
the printer will normally go through a
1:55
calibration process which takes a few
1:57
minutes to make sure that all of those
1:59
colors line up properly on the output
2:02
and because these are usually all
2:03
plastic in their construction it's
2:05
usually a good idea to recycle your ink
2:08
cartridges here's a good view of
2:10
replacing one of those inkjet cartridges
2:12
they pop right out of the slot and you
2:14
can put a new one in its
2:15
place the calibration is an important
2:18
step and you may need to calibrate the
2:20
printer even when you haven't replaced a
2:22
new cartridge this makes sure that all
2:24
of the colors align properly with the
2:26
information across all of those
2:28
individual print cartridges this
2:30
calibration is usually an automated
2:32
process but you may find that making
2:34
slight changes to the calibration can
2:37
make the output just a little bit more
2:39
crisp and have a much better result in
2:41
your final printed page here's an
2:44
example of a page that's printed for
2:45
calibration you can see a number of
2:47
colors are on this page and we have some
2:49
marks that we can use to help line up
2:51
all of those different colors together
2:53
here's a closer view of the calibration
2:56
page showing the different colors of the
2:58
CM YK and you can also see the
3:00
calibration marks so that you can line
3:02
up those very
3:04
precisely we send a lot of paper through
3:07
our inkjet printers and occasionally you
3:09
will have one of those pages catch on
3:11
the mechanisms inside the printer and
3:13
cause a paper jam many inkjet printers
3:16
provide you with a lot of access to the
3:18
entire paper path so you may be able to
3:20
open the cover of the printer and easily
3:22
remove that paper other printers may
3:24
have a more complex paper path so you
3:26
want to be very careful when removing
3:28
that paper to make sure that you're able
3:30
to pull the entire page out without
3:32
ripping any little pieces that might
3:33
stay inside of the printer once you pull
3:36
that paper out check it and make sure
3:37
that you didn't leave any parts of it
3:39
inside of the paper path and then you
3:41
can try printing your output again

if you've checked out in a store or
0:04
you've received a package in the mail
0:06
then you've either received a receipt or
0:08
a label on a package that was printed
0:11
using a thermal printer Thermal printers
0:13
work by using white paper and applying
0:16
heat to certain parts of the paper Every
0:18
part of the page that receives that heat
0:20
will turn black and we'll be able to
0:22
read the output on that page That means
0:24
there's no ink We're not using any toner
0:27
Instead we're using the chemicals built
0:29
into the page to create that final
0:33
output Another interesting
0:34
characteristic of thermal printers is
0:36
that they're relatively quiet Usually
0:39
the only thing you hear is the motor
0:41
that is used to send the paper through
0:43
the printer but the actual printing
0:45
process is nearly silent We of course
0:48
are using heat to create the final
0:50
output on this page That's why we call
0:52
it a thermal printer because of that
0:54
heat But that also means that we need to
0:57
be careful about what we do with that
0:59
output You don't want to put that
1:01
receipt or that label near another heat
1:03
source or that part of the page will
1:05
turn black as well You'll also want to
1:08
be careful about using clear tape on
1:10
your receipt or your thermal output
1:13
That's because some clear tape will
1:14
create a chemical reaction and turn that
1:17
part of the page that it touches to
1:18
white
1:20
Because there's no ink there's no toner
1:23
and there's a very specialized type of
1:25
paper that we would use These thermal
1:27
printers are relatively straightforward
1:29
in their construction The thermal paper
1:31
is pulled through the printer using this
1:33
feed assembly and very often it is
1:36
simply using friction to be able to hold
1:38
that paper in place This is a simple
1:41
receipt printer There is a roll of
1:43
thermal paper that's placed into the
1:45
printer And you can see the cover is up
1:47
on the printer right now At the very top
1:50
you can see that feed roller and it
1:52
looks like it uses a gear on the right
1:54
side to be able to propel that roller
1:57
and move the paper through the printer
1:59
Here's a better view of that feed roller
2:01
You can see it's a relatively simple
2:03
construction We simply have a roller
2:06
that is able to create that friction
2:08
with the paper and then you have a gear
2:10
on the right side that turns it to be
2:12
able to send the page through the
2:14
printer The other major component of a
2:16
thermal printer is the heating element
2:18
This extends the entire length of the
2:21
printing area Very commonly this heating
2:23
element is one single piece and does not
2:26
move inside of the printer This means
2:29
that we can simply move the page in
2:31
front of the heating element Heat will
2:32
be applied to the element in different
2:34
places as the paper is going by and you
2:37
will see that the paper turns a
2:39
different color once it is past that
2:41
heating
2:42
element You obviously can't use regular
2:44
paper inside of a thermal printer
2:47
Regular paper is not going to change
2:48
color when it gets any heat and
2:50
therefore won't be able to create any
2:52
output in a thermal printer Instead you
2:55
need a special type of paper known as
2:57
thermocchromic paper or thermal paper
2:59
This is paper that has a special coating
3:01
of chemicals on the outside that are
3:03
designed to change color when heat is
3:06
applied This is the type of paper you
3:08
see when you're using a cash register or
3:10
a credit card terminal or you receive a
3:13
package in the mail that has a label All
3:15
of those different pieces of output were
3:17
probably printed on a thermal printer
3:19
using thermal paper And if you touch the
3:22
paper you'll feel that it's a bit glossy
3:24
and has a different texture than regular
3:27
printer paper

if you're using a thermal printer you
0:03
don't have to worry about ink and you
0:05
don't have to worry about toner but you
0:06
do have to worry about the paper that
0:08
you're using the paper inside of a
0:11
thermal printer is designed to work for
0:12
thermal printers only we can't use paper
0:15
from an inkjet printer or a laser
0:17
printer inside of a thermal printer
0:20
there are also a lot of different sizes
0:22
of thermal paper that's probably because
0:25
there are a lot of different sizes of
0:27
thermal printers you'll want to make
0:29
sure that the thermal paper that you're
0:30
using is specifically designed for the
0:33
make and model of the printer that
0:35
you're using fortunately the process of
0:38
replacing thermal paper is relatively
0:40
straightforward and on most thermal
0:42
printers you can perform this process in
0:44
less than a minute here's how easy it is
0:46
we'll add a new roll of thermal paper to
0:49
this printer we'll extend the paper to
0:50
the outside of the printer and close the
0:53
top of the printer on top of it we'll
0:55
then push it down to lock it in place
0:57
and now we have a new roll of paper to
0:59
use for our next print
1:01
job there might also be times when the
1:04
heating element of your thermal printer
1:06
needs to be cleaned on most thermal
1:08
printers the heating element is usually
1:10
easy to get to and it's relatively easy
1:13
to clean we'll often use IPA or
1:15
isopropyl alcohol to clean off the
1:18
heating element without damaging the
1:20
element itself there are also cleaning
1:23
pins that have IPA that make it easy to
1:25
put the IPA in the exact place and
1:29
quickly move it back and forth to clean
1:31
off that heating element different
1:33
manufacturers have different
1:34
recommendations for how the heating
1:36
element should be cleaned and in every
1:38
case you should always check your
1:39
documentation there are also very
1:41
sensitive components inside of these
1:43
printers so you want to be very careful
1:45
when you're swabbing and cleaning off
1:47
that heating element you might also find
1:50
a cleaning card this is very similar to
1:52
sending paper through the printer but
1:54
instead the cleaning card is cleaning
1:56
the pathways and ultimately cleaning the
1:58
heating element of the printer as well
2:01
on any printer that you use over time
2:03
you'll start to get pieces of debris or
2:06
parts of the page that are little fine
2:08
pieces of dust that are inside of the
2:11
printer you will occasionally need to
2:12
clean those out of the printer to keep
2:14
everything working properly if you're
2:16
working on a thermal printer that's
2:18
relatively portable you could take that
2:20
outside and use some type of air supply
2:23
to blow out the inside of the printer to
2:25
remove all of that debris if you're not
2:27
able to move the printer you may be able
2:29
to wipe off the inside with a damp cloth
2:32
in most cases you would probably want to
2:34
avoid using a vacuum anytime you use a
2:37
traditional vacuum with a lot of dust it
2:39
tends to create static electricity and
2:42
as we know static electricity is the
2:44
enemy of our electronic components some
2:46
organizations have speciallymade vacuums
2:49
specifically for working with sensitive
2:51
electronic components so if you have one
2:54
of those computer or printer vacuums you
2:57
might want to consider using that to
2:58
clean out your
2:59
printer as the name implies a thermal
3:03
printer is using heat to be able to
3:05
create the output that we see on the
3:07
printed page if another heat source was
3:10
to come in contact with this page it
3:12
would also change the colors on the page
3:15
so you want to be very careful about
3:16
avoiding any hot areas if you have any
3:19
output from a thermal printer you would
3:21
not want to put your printed thermal
3:23
output or label anywhere near a car
3:26
dashboard on a radiator or anywhere near
3:29
a haird dryer if you do the page itself
3:32
will begin to turn dark and eventually
3:34
you won't be able to read any part of it
3:36
at all also keep in mind that thermal
3:38
paper tends to fade over time so if you
3:41
have a receipt or some other type of
3:43
output from a thermal printer and you
3:45
need to reference that receipt a year
3:47
from now you might want to have an
3:49
additional copy printed on a type of
3:51
page that is able to be archived or you
3:54
might want to take a digital image of
3:56
that receipt so that later on you know
3:58
that you'll be able to go back and
4:00
reference the information that was on
4:01
that page even if the original tends to
4:04
fade over time


one of the most common types of impact
0:04
printers is called a dot matrix printer
0:07
this is because it creates an output on
0:09
the page by using a small matrix of pins
0:12
pressing those pins against a ribbon and
0:15
eventually making a mark on the paper
0:18
and if you look very carefully at the
0:19
characters that are printed on the page
0:21
you'll see that they are made up of very
0:23
small dots those little tiny dots are
0:26
the pins inside of the dot matrix print
0:29
head since these pins are pushing on the
0:31
paper itself it's perfect to use for
0:34
carbon copies or multiple copies where
0:36
pushing on one page will create more
0:39
copies of that page behind it this is
0:42
also a relatively low cost per page so
0:44
if you're printing a lot of output you
0:46
may be able to save money by using a dot
0:49
matrix printer but unfortunately these
0:51
are relatively noisy printers so if
0:53
you're working in a library or somewhere
0:55
where it's very quiet this might not be
0:58
the right printer to use and as you can
1:00
see from the characters that are printed
1:02
on this page this is a very poor printer
1:05
to use if you're trying to create any
1:07
highresolution output this is why we
1:09
rarely find dot matrix printers in our
1:12
homes and our businesses these days and
1:14
instead it is used in very niche cases
1:17
where the best possible printer for that
1:20
particular use would be something like a
1:22
dot matrix
1:23
printer this printer head moves back and
1:26
forth across the page there are small
1:27
pins inside the print head the small
1:30
pins are inside the very front of that
1:32
print head it is pushing those pins into
1:35
the ribbon where the ink is and that ink
1:37
is being transferred to the paper that's
1:39
behind it if we were to look at the
1:41
print head it's relatively small and you
1:43
can see there's a pretty large heat sink
1:45
on the back of it because these print
1:47
heads do get relatively warm but it is a
1:50
single print matrix so to be able to
1:52
print on an entire page we would have to
1:54
move that print matrix back and forth
1:56
across the page and then move the page
1:58
up to print the next line here's a
2:01
better view of this dot matrix printer
2:03
in use you can see the print head moving
2:05
back and forth across the paper and you
2:07
can see the page is moving underneath
2:09
the print head to be able to print on
2:11
other parts of the
2:13
page if we were to remove the print head
2:16
from the printer and look at the print
2:18
head itself you could see that is
2:19
relatively small this is the matrix of
2:22
pins that are on the print head and that
2:24
is what is making connection with the
2:26
ribbon and ultimately with the page
2:27
behind it the printer ribbon itself is
2:31
usually one cartridge that fits inside
2:33
of the printer and the ribbon usually
2:35
stretches all the way across the page
2:37
making it easier for that print head to
2:39
move back and forth to make the output
2:42
this is a single unending ribbon so it
2:45
will cycle all the way through this
2:46
printer ribbon case come out the other
2:48
side and keep going over and over again
2:51
until you replace the entire cartridge
2:54
fortunately it's relatively easy to
2:56
replace these cartridges they pop right
2:57
out of the printer you can put a new one
2:59
in place and usually that exchange only
3:01
takes a few seconds different makes and
3:04
models of dot matrix printers tend to
3:06
use different sizes of printer ribbons
3:09
so when you're replacing this ribbon you
3:11
want to be sure to get the right ribbon
3:12
for the make and model of printer that
3:14
you're using if we were to pop open the
3:17
top of that printer ribbon you would see
3:19
that it is one long piece inside and it
3:22
usually collapses into itself in that
3:25
repository area until it's ready to come
3:27
out and make contact with the
3:29
page not only do we have this ribbon
3:32
that is moving as the print head is
3:34
going back and forth but very often
3:36
we're using a tractor feed to pull the
3:38
paper through the printer itself this is
3:41
regular printer paper but there are
3:42
holes on the left and right side those
3:45
holes line up with these tractor feeds
3:47
that are connected to the printer and
3:49
that pull the page into the printer so
3:51
that we can move it past the print head
3:53
these holes have to line up perfectly on
3:56
each side so that the page is straight
3:58
if you miss one of these holes when
3:59
you're trying to add more paper or you
4:01
happen to misalign it as it's going into
4:03
the printer then you're probably going
4:05
to end up with a paper jam we often
4:08
refer to this paper as tractor paper
4:10
because it has these tractor feed holes
4:12
on the left and right side this might be
4:14
one long continuous piece of paper or it
4:17
may be perforated so that you can have
4:19
standard size paper once it goes through
4:21
the printer many of these tractor feed
4:23
pages also have perforation so that you
4:26
can remove those little tractor feed
4:28
holes on the left and right side and end
4:30
up with a page that looks relatively
4:32
normal when you're finished and in some
4:34
IT environments you might still be using
4:36
green bar paper like the one we have
4:38
here this is commonly used on dot matrix
4:40
printers you can see the tractor feeds
4:42
on the left and right side and it was
4:44
commonly used to output source code so
4:46
that programmers could work on their
4:48
output on something that was
4:50
printed one common use of dot matrix
4:53
printers is to use a multi-art paper
4:56
this means that we can have one pass
4:58
through the printer and have multiple
5:00
copies that we printed using that impact
5:02
printer we traditionally used carbon or
5:05
carbon paper to be able to create that
5:07
additional copy but a less expensive and
5:10
easier to manage process uses
5:12
microenccapsulated ink on the back of
5:15
that very first sheet this uses clay on
5:18
the second sheet that has a reaction to
5:20
that ink to create that additional copy
5:23
underneath this creates that copy on the
5:25
second page without us physically
5:28
touching the second page itself this
5:30
combination of inks and dyes with the
5:33
clay that's on the paper can create
5:35
irritants in some people so you may find
5:37
that after you use these multi-art
5:39
papers over a period of time that you
5:42
may have some irritation to the skin
5:44
many organizations have found it easier
5:46
to simply print another copy instead of
5:49
having this multi-art paper with an
5:51
impact printer ultimately it might be
5:53
less expensive and easier to manage than
5:56
all of these moving parts inside of a
5:58
dot matrix printer and as the popularity
6:00
of dot matrix printers is fading away
6:03
you may find it easier and much more
6:05
convenient to use a different type of
6:07
printer

replacing the ribbon in a dot matrix
0:04
printer is something that you will do
0:05
from time to time because this printer
0:08
does lose ink this is one very long
0:11
printer ribbon that is wrapped up and
0:13
wrapped around inside of this printer
0:15
cartridge so eventually after this
0:17
printer ribbon rotates a number of times
0:19
through this system we tend to see that
0:21
the information on the page gets lighter
0:24
and lighter as we lose more and more ink
0:27
this will be very clear when you're
0:28
looking at the output of the printer
0:30
that it becomes very difficult to read
0:32
and so it's time to replace the entire
0:34
printer cartridge fortunately these are
0:37
designed to be pretty modular they
0:38
usually will pop right out of the
0:40
printer you can push the new one
0:42
directly in place and immediately start
0:45
using it and you'll find that replacing
0:47
this ribbon cartridge inside of a dot
0:49
matrix printer is a process that usually
0:52
takes less than a minute
0:54
the print head itself is also something
0:57
that you will occasionally need to swap
0:59
out this is a mechanical device and it
1:01
has these tiny pins on the print head
1:04
and occasionally one or more of these
1:06
pins will eventually stop working you do
1:08
want to be careful when replacing the
1:10
print head especially if the printer has
1:12
recently been used these print heads
1:15
tend to get pretty warm and you'll
1:16
notice the back of this print head is
1:18
really just one big heat sink some dot
1:21
matrix printers have a few screws that
1:23
you would remove to be able to take out
1:25
the print head but there are other dot
1:27
matrix printers that have a release
1:29
lever or a bar that you can use to
1:32
easily remove the print head without
1:34
needing to use any tools and if you're
1:36
spending the time to replace the print
1:38
head you might also want to take a few
1:40
extra moments and replace the ribbon
1:42
cartridge this means the next time you
1:44
print on this printer you'll have the
1:46
best possible output from your new print
1:48
head and your new ribbon
1:51
cartridge replacing the paper on a dot
1:54
matrix printer can sometimes be
1:55
challenging these dot matrix printers
1:57
don't tend to use single pieces of paper
2:00
instead they're using one continuously
2:02
fed piece of paper that has these
2:04
tractor feed holes on the left and right
2:07
side this means that you not only need
2:09
to align these holes properly but you
2:12
have to pay close attention if you're
2:14
using a page that has a form printed on
2:16
it this is because the printer is going
2:18
to print onto the spaces of that form
2:21
and you have to make sure that it is
2:23
aligned perfectly inside of that printer
2:25
and of course you're not using
2:27
individual pieces of paper you're using
2:30
one extremely long continuously fed
2:33
piece of paper that is being pulled
2:35
through that printer so you'll want to
2:37
make sure that you don't have anything
2:38
that would get in the way of that paper
2:40
as it's being fed through the printer if
2:42
you do the paper will tend to readjust
2:45
and ultimately jam itself inside of the
2:47
printer so make sure that the entire
2:49
length of the paper being fed into the
2:52
printer and the paper that is being fed
2:54
out of the printer is all working
2:56
without anything that's in the way or is
2:58
constraining the entire paper flow
