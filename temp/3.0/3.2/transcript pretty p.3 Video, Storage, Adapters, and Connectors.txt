## **Part 3: Video, Storage, Adapters, and Connectors**

If you’re connecting a computer to a screen or any consumer electronics to a video display, you’re probably using HDMI, which stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface. HDMI sends both audio and video through the same digital connection and has a maximum range of about 20 meters before signal loss occurs. HDMI is one of the most common connector types on monitors and televisions. It’s a 19-pin connector, referred to as a Type A connector.

DisplayPort is another video format that sends audio and video over the same connection, using a packetized form similar to Ethernet. DisplayPort is compatible with HDMI and DVI using passive adapters. Some devices use the smaller mini DisplayPort interface, but desktop computers and video cards usually have the full-size connector. DisplayPort connectors have small locks that keep the connector in place, and you need to press a button to unlock and remove it.

Older systems may use DVI, or Digital Visual Interface. DVI is a single connector type with multiple connection types, such as DVI-A, DVI-D single link, DVI-D dual link, and DVI-I. Single link supports up to 3.7 Gbps, enough for HD resolution. DVI only sends video signals, not audio. DVI-A can send analog signals and is compatible with VGA. DVI-D sends digital information, and DVI-I can send both digital and analog signals. Make sure you use the correct connector for your devices.

Legacy equipment may use VGA, or Video Graphics Array, which uses a DB15 connector. VGA connectors are usually blue and only send analog video signals. Signal quality degrades after 5 or 10 meters. Modern motherboards may support HDMI, VGA, and DVI, and the connector types are easy to differentiate.

Today, many video signals are sent over USB-C connectors, which can carry USB, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, HDMI, and MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) signals. The right cable and connection are needed for each signal type.

For storage, desktop computers use SATA, or Serial ATA, to connect hard drives. SATA revision 1.0 supported 1.5 Gbps, version 2.0 supported 3 Gbps, version 3.0 supported 6 Gbps, and revision 3.2 supported 16 Gbps. eSATA is the external version of SATA, supporting external drives over a 2-meter cable. SATA drives have two connectors: a 15-pin power connector and a 7-pin data connector. Some drives also support the older Molex power connector. SATA connections are one-to-one, so each cable connects one drive to the motherboard. eSATA connectors are different from internal SATA connectors and are not interchangeable.

In IT, you often need a certain type of cable or adapter. Sometimes you can use a cable with different connectors on each end, but sometimes you need a converter to change formats or provide power. Adapters and converters are usually for temporary use, but sometimes become permanent. DVI to HDMI cables and adapters are common because DVI-D and HDMI are electrically compatible. DVI-A and VGA are also compatible, but only at 640x480 resolution. To convert from analog VGA to digital DVI, you need a signal converter.

Modern laptops are thinner and may not have full-size RJ45 Ethernet connections, but you may still need wired connectivity. USB to Ethernet adapters are useful for this. Many laptops also lack USB-A connectors, so you may need a USB-C to USB-A adapter. USB hubs can provide multiple outputs, including USB, SD memory, HDMI, and Ethernet.

Common copper connectors include RJ11, a six-position connector with two conductors, used for analog telephone and DSL connections. RJ45 is an eight-position connector used for Ethernet and other connections. RJ11 is smaller than RJ45, and it’s easy to accidentally plug RJ11 into an RJ45 port. Coaxial copper connections use F connectors, commonly used for cable television and cable modems. The F connector has a threaded connection and a single copper conductor in the middle. Cable modems use the DOCSIS standard and connect to the network using an F connector.

In buildings with many twisted pair cables, punchdown blocks are used to terminate wires quickly and inexpensively. You push the wire into the connection and punch it down with a tool. USB connectors are also common, with standard A, B, mini B, and micro B plugs. USB-C is now the standard connector, supporting many types of signals. Older desktops may use a four-pin Molex connector for power, providing 12V and 5V for fans, drives, and other components. Molex connectors are modular and easy to connect and disconnect.

Apple devices may use a Lightning connector, which is proprietary and used for iPhones and iPads. Lightning can be inserted either way and was introduced for additional power capabilities. The industry is moving toward USB-C, but some devices still use Lightning.

System administrators and network troubleshooters may need a DB9 connection to connect to older switches, routers, and firewalls. DB9 connectors transmit serial communication using the RS232 standard, which has been around since 1969. USB is now the standard for serial communication, but DB9 connectors are still used for console ports on infrastructure devices.

For fiber optics, there are several standard interfaces. The ST (straight tip) connector is a bayonet connector that you push in and twist to lock. The SC (subscriber connector) is a square connector that locks in place when pushed in and is used across many devices and patch panels. The LC (Lucent connector) is a smaller, compact connector that holds in place with a clip. All three connectors—ST, SC, and LC—work the same way, allowing you to connect and disconnect fiber connections. It’s important to use connectors that match the devices you’re connecting to, and in many cases, you’ll use ST, SC, or LC connections.
