Copper Cabling, Ethernet Standards, and Wiring**

We often focus on the capabilities of our new laptop or desktop computer. When we connect these to the network, we naturally assume that everything will connect and work as expected. This is possible because we use the proper cables to send information across the network. These cables or fiber optics are the foundation of everything we send across the network. If you have bad cabling, your applications will not work as expected. You have to plan and install the correct cabling for the type of network you plan to use.

Even our wireless networks have cable at some point. We may communicate wirelessly to the access point, but that access point must be connected to the rest of the network over network cables. A huge number of the cables we use on our wired Ethernet networks are twisted pair copper cables. We refer to these as twisted pair because the individual wires inside the cable are twisted together into pairs. The blue pair is twisted together, as are the green, orange, and brown pairs. Each wire pair contains equal and opposite signals. The information sent over one part of the pair may be transmit plus, and the other wire in that pair is transmit minus.

The reason these wires are twisted inside the cable is that one side of the pair is constantly moving away from any interference or noise in the environment. When the signal is received on the other side, the receiver can determine what the real signal should be and what the interference might be, based on the differences in the signal received on both wires. If you look closely at the cable, you’ll notice that each wire pair is twisted at a different rate. The receiving side can compare all four wire pairs and see the differences in interference across all pairs at the same time. Since there are differences in the twist rate, the receiving device can easily see where the interference might be and where the good signal is inside the cable.

Different twisted pair cables may be constructed differently. There is a set of standards associated with these cables that determines the minimum capabilities for that particular twisted pair cable. Sometimes people refer to a cable as having a particular speed, but in reality, the cable doesn’t have a speed at all. The cable is just copper sitting there on the desk. The signals you send over the cable, however, do have a speed, and that speed is determined by the signal encoding sent over the wires.

To send those signals across the wire, we need to use a minimum category of cable for the type of signal we’re transmitting. The minimum category of cable for a particular Ethernet standard is documented in the IEEE 802.3 standard. These documents tell us the minimum category of cable supported for a particular Ethernet standard. For example, if you’re using gigabit Ethernet, you’re probably using the 1000BASE-T standard, and you need to use a minimum of category 5 cable. If you look at the outside of the cable, you’ll see printed on it what category it has been tested to. If you’re using 1000BASE-T, you need at least category 5. The category 5 standard has been deprecated, so if you’re buying new cable, you’ll probably find category 5e. Additional tests were added to the qualification for category 5 cable, so we label it as category 5e, with the E standing for enhanced.

If you have an older installation of category 5 wiring, you can run 1000BASE-T over that cable to a distance of 100 meters. If you’re installing new cable, you’re probably installing category 5e, which also supports 1000BASE-T to 100 meters. If you’re running 10 gigabit speeds, you may be using 10GBASE-T, which is 10 gigabit Ethernet over unshielded twisted pair cable, and you need a minimum of category 6 cable. Unshielded category 6 can run for 55 meters, while shielded category 6 can run for 100 meters. Category 6A, where the A stands for augmented, can run 10GBASE-T to 100 meters.

If you’re ever wondering what category of cable you should use, always refer to the IEEE standards. If you’re running a 10GBASE-T network, check the IEEE standards for the minimum category of cable supported for that Ethernet type.

Twisted pair cable is not the only type of copper cable you might find. Another common copper type is coaxial cable. Coaxial means two or more forms sharing a common axis. The inner conductor is where all the signal goes, and there is an outer shield to protect the signals running on the internal wire. Coax is often used for cable modems or digital cable. Anytime you’re running high-speed internet over cable infrastructures, you’re probably using a coaxial cable.

We also talked about unshielded and shielded cable. The type you use depends on the standards and how far you need the cable to go. Unshielded twisted pair, or UTP, has no shielding at all. There’s no shielding around the outside of all four pairs, and none around each pair. Shielded twisted pair uses a shield inside the cable to help protect against interference. This shield can be around all four pairs or around each individual pair. The outside of the wire often tells you what type of cable and shielding is used. U means unshielded, S refers to braided shielding, and F refers to foil shielding. The abbreviation on the cable specifies the shielding used for the overall cable, then a slash, then the abbreviation for the individual pairs, ending with TP for twisted pair. For example, S/FTP means braided shielding around the entire cable and foil around each pair. F/UTP means foil around the outside and no shielding for the individual pairs.

There are also direct burial STP cables designed to be installed in the ground. These are usually waterproofed and may have a gel inside to repel water. They are usually shielded twisted pair cables, which helps against interference and grounds the cable, adding strength. Structurally, they look similar to shielded Ethernet cables used inside a network, with four pairs of wires and a shield around all pairs. There’s often a wire running the length of the cable used as an electrical ground, sometimes called a drain wire.

In commercial buildings, you may see cables above a drop ceiling. Above the drop ceiling might be ductwork for air supply and return. If the airspace above the ceiling is not circulating, it’s not a plenum. In many environments, the return air goes into the open space above the ceiling, called plenum space. This makes it easy for fire, smoke, and toxic fumes to move freely, so network cables above the ceiling must be plenum-rated. Plenum-rated cables have a fire-rated jacket, such as fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or low-smoke PVC. These cables may be less flexible but are necessary for safety.

Ethernet wiring is standardized internationally. In the US, the TIA has created the ANSI/TIA-568 standard for cable installation in commercial buildings. This standard defines what wires go on what pins with which connectors. The T568A and T568B color schemes are used for RJ45 connections. The colors used in each standard are slightly different. In the US, T568B is most commonly used. Organizations are usually consistent with their wiring standards. You should never mix T568A on one end of a cable and T568B on the other. Understanding the color schemes is important for both exams and real-world cabling. The blue and brown colors are the same between the two standards, so you only need to memorize the differences for pins 1, 2, 3, and 6. You should be able to look at a cable and determine which color scheme was used. When crimping your own cables, it’s easy to get wrong, so always check the wires before crimping.

Sometimes you’ll use a jack where you punch down the cables, and the jack tells you what colors to use for each connection. The A colors are along the top, and the B colors are along the bottom. The jack may not follow the same color scheme as T568A or T568B, but internally it puts the correct pins in the right place on the RJ45 connector.

Fiber Optics, USB, Serial, and Thunderbolt

If you walk into a data center, you’ll find a lot of equipment that runs using optical fiber. Instead of using copper with electrical signals, we send light through a fiber to transmit information. This means we don’t have to worry about interference from other equipment or radio frequency devices. However, it’s more difficult to monitor or tap into the connection, and you need specialized equipment for fiber optic networks. Unlike copper signals, which degrade over short distances, fiber optics can extend many kilometers without needing to regenerate the signal. In environments with a lot of industrial equipment or interference, fiber optic connections are ideal.

One challenge with fiber optics is that there are many different types of fiber and connectors. A fiber optic cable has a core where the light travels, surrounded by cladding with a lower reflective index to keep the light inside. The core and cladding are protected by a buffer coating. There are two main types of fiber optic cables: multimode and single mode. Multimode fiber is used for short-range communication, typically up to about 2 kilometers. It uses an inexpensive light source, usually an LED. The fiber is relatively large, and the light can take different paths through the fiber. Single mode fiber is designed for long-range communication, with some standards supporting up to 100 kilometers without regeneration. Single mode fiber uses lasers and has a much narrower core, allowing the light to travel in a single path.

If you’ve connected any peripheral device to your computer, you’ve probably used a USB cable. USB stands for Universal Serial Bus and is the standard connection for keyboards, mice, and almost any other device. USB 1.1 operated at low speed (1.5 Mbps) and full speed (12 Mbps), with cable lengths of 3 meters for low speed and 5 meters for full speed. USB 2.0 increased throughput to 480 Mbps over a 5-meter cable. USB 3.0, called SuperSpeed, operates at 5 Gbps over a 3-meter cable. USB 3.1 supports 10 Gbps, and USB 3.2 supports 20 Gbps.

USB connectors have evolved over time. USB 1.1 and 2.0 used standard A and B plugs, as well as mini B and micro B plugs for mobile devices. USB 3.0 updated the B and micro B plugs. To standardize, the USB-C connector was created. USB-C can replace all previous USB connector types and can be plugged in either orientation. USB-C describes the physical interface, not the type of signal, so many different signals can be sent over a USB-C cable.

Before USB, we used serial cables, such as DB9 and DB25 connectors. DB9 refers to the size of the connector, and DB25 refers to the number of pins. These connections use the RS232 standard, which has been around since 1969. Serial connections were used for modems, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals before USB. Today, DB9 connectors are used for legacy equipment like older switches and routers, allowing you to connect to the serial or console port for configuration. Modern computers often lack DB9 connectors, so we use adapters to convert USB-C to DB9 or RJ45 for console connections.

Another method of connecting peripherals is Thunderbolt, a high-speed serial connection that carries data and power on the same cable. Thunderbolt 1 used the mini DisplayPort connector and provided two channels of 10 Gbps each. Thunderbolt 2 increased throughput to 20 Gbps. Modern Thunderbolt uses the USB-C connector, providing 40 Gbps of aggregated throughput. Thunderbolt 3 supports copper cables up to 3 meters and optical cables up to 60 meters. Thunderbolt allows daisy chaining devices, so you can connect multiple devices in a chain. Thunderbolt 4 maintains 40 Gbps throughput and improves video output to support dual 4K displays, increasing bandwidth to the PCI Express bus.

Video, Storage, Adapters, and Connectors

If you’re connecting a computer to a screen or any consumer electronics to a video display, you’re probably using HDMI, which stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface. HDMI sends both audio and video through the same digital connection and has a maximum range of about 20 meters before signal loss occurs. HDMI is one of the most common connector types on monitors and televisions. It’s a 19-pin connector, referred to as a Type A connector.

DisplayPort is another video format that sends audio and video over the same connection, using a packetized form similar to Ethernet. DisplayPort is compatible with HDMI and DVI using passive adapters. Some devices use the smaller mini DisplayPort interface, but desktop computers and video cards usually have the full-size connector. DisplayPort connectors have small locks that keep the connector in place, and you need to press a button to unlock and remove it.

Older systems may use DVI, or Digital Visual Interface. DVI is a single connector type with multiple connection types, such as DVI-A, DVI-D single link, DVI-D dual link, and DVI-I. Single link supports up to 3.7 Gbps, enough for HD resolution. DVI only sends video signals, not audio. DVI-A can send analog signals and is compatible with VGA. DVI-D sends digital information, and DVI-I can send both digital and analog signals. Make sure you use the correct connector for your devices.

Legacy equipment may use VGA, or Video Graphics Array, which uses a DB15 connector. VGA connectors are usually blue and only send analog video signals. Signal quality degrades after 5 or 10 meters. Modern motherboards may support HDMI, VGA, and DVI, and the connector types are easy to differentiate.

Today, many video signals are sent over USB-C connectors, which can carry USB, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, HDMI, and MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) signals. The right cable and connection are needed for each signal type.

For storage, desktop computers use SATA, or Serial ATA, to connect hard drives. SATA revision 1.0 supported 1.5 Gbps, version 2.0 supported 3 Gbps, version 3.0 supported 6 Gbps, and revision 3.2 supported 16 Gbps. eSATA is the external version of SATA, supporting external drives over a 2-meter cable. SATA drives have two connectors: a 15-pin power connector and a 7-pin data connector. Some drives also support the older Molex power connector. SATA connections are one-to-one, so each cable connects one drive to the motherboard. eSATA connectors are different from internal SATA connectors and are not interchangeable.

In IT, you often need a certain type of cable or adapter. Sometimes you can use a cable with different connectors on each end, but sometimes you need a converter to change formats or provide power. Adapters and converters are usually for temporary use, but sometimes become permanent. DVI to HDMI cables and adapters are common because DVI-D and HDMI are electrically compatible. DVI-A and VGA are also compatible, but only at 640x480 resolution. To convert from analog VGA to digital DVI, you need a signal converter.

Modern laptops are thinner and may not have full-size RJ45 Ethernet connections, but you may still need wired connectivity. USB to Ethernet adapters are useful for this. Many laptops also lack USB-A connectors, so you may need a USB-C to USB-A adapter. USB hubs can provide multiple outputs, including USB, SD memory, HDMI, and Ethernet.

Common copper connectors include RJ11, a six-position connector with two conductors, used for analog telephone and DSL connections. RJ45 is an eight-position connector used for Ethernet and other connections. RJ11 is smaller than RJ45, and it’s easy to accidentally plug RJ11 into an RJ45 port. Coaxial copper connections use F connectors, commonly used for cable television and cable modems. The F connector has a threaded connection and a single copper conductor in the middle. Cable modems use the DOCSIS standard and connect to the network using an F connector.

In buildings with many twisted pair cables, punchdown blocks are used to terminate wires quickly and inexpensively. You push the wire into the connection and punch it down with a tool. USB connectors are also common, with standard A, B, mini B, and micro B plugs. USB-C is now the standard connector, supporting many types of signals. Older desktops may use a four-pin Molex connector for power, providing 12V and 5V for fans, drives, and other components. Molex connectors are modular and easy to connect and disconnect.

Apple devices may use a Lightning connector, which is proprietary and used for iPhones and iPads. Lightning can be inserted either way and was introduced for additional power capabilities. The industry is moving toward USB-C, but some devices still use Lightning.

System administrators and network troubleshooters may need a DB9 connection to connect to older switches, routers, and firewalls. DB9 connectors transmit serial communication using the RS232 standard, which has been around since 1969. USB is now the standard for serial communication, but DB9 connectors are still used for console ports on infrastructure devices.

For fiber optics, there are several standard interfaces. The ST (straight tip) connector is a bayonet connector that you push in and twist to lock. The SC (subscriber connector) is a square connector that locks in place when pushed in and is used across many devices and patch panels. The LC (Lucent connector) is a smaller, compact connector that holds in place with a clip. All three connectors—ST, SC, and LC—work the same way, allowing you to connect and disconnect fiber connections. It’s important to use connectors that match the devices you’re connecting to, and in many cases, you’ll use ST, SC, or LC connections.
