many organizations use peripherals that
0:04
are able to accomplish many things in
0:06
one single unit we refer to these as
0:08
multi-function devices or MFDs these
0:12
might be a printer a scanner and a fax
0:14
all in one device and these might
0:17
connect to a wired network a wireless
0:19
network they might have a phone line
0:21
connection for the fax capabilities or
0:23
you may be able to send it print jobs
0:26
from your mobile device across the web
0:28
with devices that are able to do so many
0:31
different things there are also so many
0:33
opportunities for things to go wrong and
0:35
as the technician you'll be the one
0:37
repairing these multi-function
0:39
devices a multi-function device at home
0:42
might be a relatively small unit about
0:44
the size of a typical printer but in an
0:47
office environment these might be
0:48
relatively large so you might have to
0:51
find a separate area for setting this up
0:53
that is outside of the normal walkway
0:56
these multifunction devices need a power
0:58
connection they often need a wired
1:00
network connection and you need to
1:02
install them in a place that is
1:03
accessible by everyone in the
1:06
organization we not only need to
1:08
physically install this multi-function
1:10
device we also need to configure our
1:12
workstation so that it can properly
1:14
print to these devices to accomplish
1:16
this we'll need to install the printer
1:18
drivers on everyone's computer for that
1:20
specific model of multi-function device
1:23
this follows a similar process for a
1:25
standalone printer we need to find
1:27
exactly the right printer driver for the
1:29
operating system that we happen to be
1:30
using and we need to make sure that if
1:32
we're using a 32-bit operating system
1:34
that we're using a 32-bit print driver
1:36
and if we're using a 64-bit operating
1:39
system that we have a 64-bit printer
1:41
driver to be able to take advantage of
1:44
all of the multi-function capabilities
1:46
of this device we need to make sure that
1:48
we are using the correct printer driver
1:50
so check your documentation and confirm
1:53
that you're using the right printer
1:54
driver for the model of device that
1:57
you're
1:58
installing another important
1:59
consideration is the page description
2:02
language that is being used by that
2:04
multi-function device you'll commonly
2:06
find two different page description
2:08
languages used one is a PCL or a printer
2:12
command language that is created by
2:14
Huelet Packard if you have an HP printer
2:16
it's probably capable of using the
2:18
printer command language the printer
2:21
might also support a page description
2:23
language known as Postcript this was
2:25
originally created by Adobe Systems and
2:28
it's a very common language to find
2:30
across many different types of printers
2:32
if we were to look at the communication
2:34
that was occurring between your
2:36
workstation and the printer you would
2:38
have output that's very similar to this
2:40
this is the postcript language that is
2:42
received by the printer the printer is
2:44
able to read this document and then
2:46
render a printed page based on the
2:48
information inside of this postcript
2:50
file the printer is able to interpret
2:52
that language it renders the page and
2:54
then prints it and the final output
2:56
looks something like this if you have a
2:59
PCL printer you need to make sure that
3:01
you're using a PCL printer driver if you
3:04
have a printer that talks Postcript then
3:06
you'll need to make sure you have a
3:07
Postcript printer driver there are some
3:09
printers where you can select the
3:11
printer to use either PCL or Postcript
3:14
so you want to be sure to use the
3:15
appropriate driver for the configuration
3:17
of your printer these multi-function
3:20
devices have many different capabilities
3:23
and of course there's no operating
3:24
system that we normally would have
3:26
access to on these devices when you
3:29
start this system it loads the operating
3:31
system for this device that we refer to
3:33
as firmware this firmware controls what
3:36
this device does when you send it
3:38
printer output when you have it scan
3:40
information or when you're sending a fax
3:42
there are many times that the
3:43
manufacturer of these multi-function
3:45
devices will fix a bug or they may
3:47
release new features to do this they'll
3:50
provide a new version of firmware for
3:52
this device and you'll need to install
3:54
that firmware to either upgrade and fix
3:56
those bugs or to provide those
3:58
additional features this firmware is
4:00
usually available on the multiffunction
4:02
device website and they have an entire
4:05
set of instructions on the process
4:06
that's used to properly install the
4:08
firmware make sure you reference this
4:10
documentation because every
4:12
multiffunction device has a different
4:14
process for upgrading the
4:16
firmware if you're directly connecting
4:19
to one of these multifunction devices
4:21
there are a number of interfaces that
4:23
you might find one is a USB connection
4:26
this is a very common connection that
4:28
we're all very familiar with but there
4:30
are certainly more than one type of USB
4:33
connection for example you might be
4:34
plugging into your computer using this
4:36
type A connection but the printer itself
4:38
might be using a typeB or even a USBC
4:41
connection we might also be plugging
4:44
directly into a network and in that case
4:46
we may be connecting to an RJ45 Ethernet
4:49
connection on the back of that
4:50
multi-function device and in some of
4:53
these devices you may be able to connect
4:54
to multiple interfaces simultaneously so
4:57
you might plug your computer into the
4:59
USB typeB connection and then you might
5:01
also plug your network connection into
5:03
the RJ45 Ethernet connection here's an
5:07
example of a back of a multi-function
5:09
device that does have an RJ45 network
5:11
connection you can see it's live on the
5:13
network right now this one also has a
5:15
USB typeB connection on the back of the
5:18
printer as well
5:19
your printer might also connect to
5:21
devices over a wireless link some
5:24
printers will support a Bluetooth
5:26
connection bluetooth of course has a
5:27
limited range so if you're planning to
5:29
use Bluetooth as your connection you'll
5:31
need to be in close proximity to the
5:33
multi-function device a more common
5:35
wireless connection is probably the
5:38
802.11 specifically the infrastructure
5:40
mode of 802.11 this means that the
5:43
multiffunction device will connect to an
5:45
access point giving everyone on the
5:47
network the ability to communicate to
5:49
that device some multifunction devices
5:52
support 802.11 wireless connectivity in
5:55
an ad hoc mode this is a point-to-point
5:58
connection between two devices where an
6:00
access point is not going to be used if
6:03
you have a single computer that needs to
6:05
communicate to a multi-function device
6:06
in an area where an access point is not
6:09
located then you'll probably use the
6:11
802.11 ad hoc mode in many organizations
6:15
there will be many people that need
6:16
access to this multi-function device and
6:19
one of the ways that you can share this
6:21
device is from a computer that is
6:23
directly connected to that
6:24
multi-function device you would normally
6:26
do this through the operating system
6:28
running on that computer there's usually
6:30
a sharing tab in the printer properties
6:32
and then you can decide the name of that
6:34
printer that will be used on the network
6:37
one of the challenges in using this
6:39
method of printer sharing is if the
6:41
computer connected to the printer is
6:42
turned off no one is able to print to
6:44
that printer instead most organizations
6:47
will use a print server this is a
6:49
separate service that's usually running
6:51
inside the printer itself although there
6:53
are also external print servers that you
6:56
can purchase these print servers allow
6:58
you to send print jobs directly to the
7:00
print server and the print server then
7:02
manages the printing process to the
7:04
multi-function device for management
7:06
there's usually a web-based frontend to
7:08
the print server or some type of client
7:10
software that allows you to see what
7:12
jobs may be in the queue and allows you
7:14
to administratively add and remove jobs
7:17
from that printer
7:18
queue nobody likes to waste printer
7:21
paper and one of the ways that you can
7:23
conserve this paper is to print on both
7:25
sides of the page many printers will
7:27
allow this functionality through a
7:29
duplex capability this will allow you to
7:32
send a print job to the printer tell it
7:34
to print in a duplex mode and the output
7:36
that you get from the printer will
7:37
automatically be printed on both sides
7:39
of the page not all printers support a
7:42
duplex process and it may require
7:45
additional hardware installed in the
7:47
printer to be able to provide duplex
7:49
printing these multi-function devices
7:52
also support printing in different
7:54
orientations you can print in a portrait
7:56
orientation where the page is longer
7:58
towards the top and the bottom or you
8:01
can print in a landscape orientation
8:02
where the longer side of the page is on
8:05
the left and right side of the output as
8:08
the page is going through the
8:09
multi-function device the page itself is
8:11
not turning the printer is simply
8:13
printing in the orientation that you
8:15
selected
8:17
you may find on some of these larger
8:18
multi-function devices that there are
8:20
multiple paper trays on that device and
8:23
when you're printing your output you can
8:25
choose which paper tray will be used as
8:28
this final output this may have a plain
8:30
paper in the top tray you might have
8:32
letter head in another tray and you
8:35
might have different sizes of paper in
8:37
different trays during the printing
8:39
process you have the option to choose
8:41
which tray you'd like to use this
8:43
particular printer uses the letter tray
8:45
as the one that is automatically
8:46
selected and that letter tray is tray
8:49
number one you can also print to number
8:51
10 envelopes in tray number two you can
8:53
print on legal size paper on tray number
8:56
three you can print on 9 by 12in
8:58
envelopes on tray number four so if you
9:01
find that your output is being printed
9:03
from the wrong tray you might want to
9:05
check your settings when you're sending
9:06
that print job to the printer during the
9:09
printing process you'll have the option
9:10
to select the one that is automatic or
9:13
you can manually choose exactly which
9:15
tray you'd like to use for that
9:17
particular print job you also have the
9:20
option to choose what type of quality
9:22
you would like for the final output this
9:24
usually gives you an option to decide
9:26
what level of resolution you would like
9:28
to use during the output whether you'd
9:30
like to use color or grayscale in that
9:32
output and if you are using color you
9:35
might have the option to use a color
9:36
saving mode so that you're not using as
9:38
much ink as you would with a non-color
9:41
saving mode on this printer the
9:43
resolution is defined as the print
9:46
quality you can see by default it's set
9:47
to 600 by 600 but if you'd like to save
9:50
some toner in this particular laser
9:52
printer you could set that to a lower
9:54
resolution this one also supports color
9:56
printing the default is a true color but
9:59
you could also modify that to be a
10:00
different quality of color output which
10:02
might save you some of the resources in
10:04
this multi-function device if you do
10:07
have a printer that is a unique style of
10:09
printer or it's one that prints very
10:11
expensive types of output you may want
10:14
to limit who has access to print on that
10:16
multi-function device you can normally
10:18
provide this through user authentication
10:21
this might be built into the printer
10:23
sharing that you already set up or may
10:25
be part of the print server that you're
10:26
using you would set rights and
10:28
permissions for individual users or
10:30
groups of users and you can define who's
10:33
allowed to print on the printer and
10:34
who's allowed to manage that printer one
10:37
of the challenges that you have when you
10:38
have a central printing device is that
10:40
it's usually in the open where anyone
10:42
can access that device but if you're
10:44
printing sensitive information you may
10:47
not want that information simply sitting
10:49
on top of the printer for that reason
10:51
you may want to enable badging with
10:53
badging you would send your print job to
10:55
the printer but the printer is not going
10:57
to print that particular job instead the
11:00
printer will wait for you to physically
11:02
visit the printer and use your badge to
11:04
authenticate yourself with the printing
11:06
device then it will start to print the
11:09
output while you're standing in front of
11:11
the printer ensuring security of that
11:13
output
11:15
printing anything in a physical format
11:17
costs money and some of these printers
11:19
can output high resolution in full color
11:22
which costs even more money for that
11:25
reason many organizations will want to
11:27
audit who is printing to the printer and
11:29
how much they're printing many printers
11:31
include an audit log in the printer
11:34
itself or in the operating system that's
11:36
used to share the printer you can
11:37
usually find this in the security
11:39
monitoring of the printer or if you're
11:41
using Windows you can find that
11:42
information in the event viewer and some
11:45
multifunction devices allow you to
11:47
configure secured prints this allows you
11:49
to define a passcode for that printer
11:52
you send the print job to the printer
11:54
and then you have to visit the printer
11:56
to manually input that passcode before
11:58
the printer will start the printing
12:00
process this is another way of ensuring
12:02
the protection of the information that
12:04
you're printing without requiring any
12:06
external cards or separate pieces of
12:09
equipment you simply visit the printer
12:11
type in your PIN and it prints the
12:13
output you would normally configure this
12:15
on the printer this printer supports
12:17
Windows PIN protected printing and
12:19
inside of your Windows operating system
12:22
you would specify what personal
12:23
identification number or PIN you would
12:26
like to use you would then visit the
12:28
printer you would input your personal
12:30
identification number and your output
12:31
would begin to
12:33
print not only can these multifunction
12:35
devices be output devices we can also
12:38
use them as input devices many of these
12:41
multi-function devices are flatbed
12:43
scanners this means that we can take a
12:45
printed physical document put it on top
12:48
of the multi-function device it will
12:50
scan this device and create a digital
12:52
format of that physical page some of
12:55
these might even include an ADF or an
12:57
automatic document feeder so you can put
13:00
many pages into the multiffunction
13:02
device hit one button to scan and it
13:04
will go through many pages and scan all
13:07
of those to a digital
13:09
file our modern multifunction devices
13:12
can scan information and email you the
13:15
results of that individual scan for
13:17
small scanning jobs it might make sense
13:19
to send that to your email but for
13:21
larger scanning jobs your email inbox
13:24
may not be the best place to send these
13:27
very large attachments instead you might
13:29
want to scan directly to a shared drive
13:32
on your network we refer to this as
13:34
scanning to a folder or scanning to SMB
13:38
that stands for server message block
13:40
which is the standard format used on
13:42
Microsoft Windows devices this is
13:44
effectively sending anything that's
13:46
scanned to an existing Microsoft share
13:49
and then you can simply visit that share
13:51
drive on your computer to access your
13:53
digitized files and in today's world of
13:56
cloud computing and high-speed
13:58
networking we can also scan to an
14:00
external device that's located in the
14:02
cloud so we might want to specify a
14:05
Google Drive account or a Dropbox
14:07
account put our paper into the scanner
14:10
hit a button and everything will be sent
14:12
to our drive in the cloud
