0:02
if you've ever walked into a computer
0:03
room or a data center then you've seen
0:05
rack after rack of different devices
0:09
servers and other components each one of
0:12
those devices performs a particular
0:14
function on that network and they all
0:16
have their role that they play sometimes
0:18
these devices are standalone components
0:21
but often we will combine these
0:22
components together into one single
0:24
device for example at home you probably
0:27
are connected to the internet using some
0:29
type of wireless router that's a router
0:31
a switch an access point and security
0:34
software all in the same device in this
0:37
video we'll show you these separate
0:39
devices and we'll talk about how each
0:41
device is used to connect the entire
0:43
network
0:44
together to be able to communicate from
0:46
one IP subnet to another we need a
0:49
router routers are devices that make
0:51
forwarding decisions based on the
0:53
destination IP address contained within
0:55
a packet the router has a table inside
0:58
that tells it where it should be sending
1:00
traffic it then evaluates that
1:02
destination IP address and then sends it
1:04
out the appropriate interface some
1:06
organizations will use devices that are
1:08
both routers and switches in the same
1:11
device and since routers operate at OSI
1:14
layer 3 those devices are often referred
1:16
to as layer 3 switches you might also
1:20
see routers used to connect different
1:21
types of networks together so it's not
1:23
unusual to connect an Ethernet network
1:26
to a wireless network a wireless network
1:28
to a serial network a fiber network to a
1:30
copper network and so on so not only are
1:33
we routing between different IP subnets
1:36
we may also be converting to different
1:38
topologies using our router if you're
1:41
plugged into the wired access on a
1:44
network then you're probably connected
1:45
to a switch a switch is a way to connect
1:48
all of these end devices and be able to
1:51
forward traffic based on the destination
1:53
MAC address these switches often operate
1:56
very quickly and they're able to do that
1:58
because they do all of the switching in
2:00
the hardware of the switch itself very
2:02
often this hardware is an
2:04
applicationspecific integrated circuit
2:06
or an ASIC and this gives that switch
2:09
the speed that it needs to keep up with
2:11
our high-speed local area networks since
2:14
most of the wired devices on your
2:16
network are connected to a switch these
2:18
switches have to have a large number of
2:19
interfaces on them they might be a 24 or
2:23
48 port switch in the case of a workg
2:25
groupoup switch and in the core of our
2:27
network we might have switches with
2:29
hundreds of interfaces on them this is
2:31
also where you might have power over
2:33
Ethernet capabilities so that you would
2:35
run both Ethernet data and power over
2:38
those same wires this allows you to
2:40
connect phones wireless access points
2:43
and even laptops to an Ethernet
2:45
connection and have it not only use that
2:47
Ethernet connection for data but also
2:49
power the device itself and as we've
2:52
mentioned many switches not only have
2:54
the switching functionality but might
2:56
also have routing functionality in that
2:58
same device we often refer to these as
3:01
layer three switches or multi-layer
3:04
switches some switches are relatively
3:07
simple you plug them in provide power
3:09
and then you connect all of the devices
3:11
you need to that particular switch
3:13
there's no way to differentiate between
3:15
different VLANs on the switch the switch
3:17
may not even have any management
3:19
functionality or configuration settings
3:21
it is effectively a plug-and-play device
3:24
we refer to these relatively simple
3:26
switches as unmanaged switches which
3:29
means there's no management that you
3:30
need to do to be able to get this switch
3:32
to operate but this also means there's
3:34
no additional configurations you could
3:36
make for example you can't configure
3:38
this switch to have different VLANs on
3:40
different interfaces effectively the
3:42
entire switch is one big VLAN this also
3:45
means there's no way to configure this
3:47
switch to communicate back to any of
3:49
your management stations so there's
3:51
probably no SNMP or simple network
3:53
management protocol functionality
3:55
there's no logs that's being stored on
3:57
this switch it is effectively an
3:59
unmanaged switch but one of the
4:02
advantages of not having a lot of
4:04
different configuration settings and
4:05
options is that there's usually a lower
4:07
price point so if you're looking for a
4:10
simple connectivity device that doesn't
4:12
have a lot of configuration options you
4:14
probably want to use an unmanaged switch
4:17
on an enterprise network however you
4:19
need a switch that you're able to manage
4:21
remotely configure with advanced
4:23
settings and if that's the case then you
4:25
need a manage switch a managed switch is
4:28
usually a larger device this often has
4:30
VLAN functionality so you can configure
4:32
different VLANs on different interfaces
4:35
it might have a way to prioritize
4:37
different traffic patterns so that your
4:39
web traffic might have a higher priority
4:40
than your FTP traffic these might also
4:43
provide with redundancy support so you
4:45
can have multiple switches on your
4:47
network at the same time and configure
4:49
them in a way so that they are redundant
4:51
to each other if you lose one of the
4:53
switches you have a power failure or the
4:55
switch itself fails you have another
4:57
switch on the network that can take up
4:59
the additional load many managed
5:02
switches also allow you to perform port
5:04
mirroring that means you can plug in a
5:06
protocol analysis tool or other security
5:08
device to any of these interfaces and
5:11
then redirect or mirror traffic from one
5:13
interface to that monitoring device so
5:16
if you are in an enterprise and you need
5:19
remote management functionality through
5:21
SNMP or a direct configuration option
5:24
you might want to use a manage
5:27
switch if you have devices that need to
5:29
connect to the network over a wireless
5:31
connection then you need an access point
5:34
this is a bit different than the
5:36
wireless router that you might have in a
5:38
small office or home office
5:39
configuration because this is not a
5:42
router it simply switches between a
5:44
wired network on one side and a wireless
5:46
network on the other we often refer to
5:49
this as a bridged communication because
5:51
there's no translation of IP addresses
5:53
there's no routing that's taking place
5:55
we are effectively switching between a
5:57
wireless network and a wired network on
6:00
the other side because of that an access
6:02
point is making its forwarding decision
6:04
very similar to a switch because it's
6:06
looking at the destination MAC address
6:09
that means the access point will
6:10
evaluate a frame and determine if that
6:12
frame needs to go out the wireless
6:14
network or if it should be forwarded
6:15
onto the wired network if you were to
6:19
look at a corporate network you would
6:21
see a lot of cubes and offices that are
6:23
out on the floor of a building each one
6:26
of those desks is probably connected
6:28
back to a central closet using an
6:30
Ethernet cable that cable is usually
6:33
terminated inside of that closet onto a
6:35
punchdown block this allows you to run
6:38
that cable between the desk and the
6:40
closet and lock everything down onto
6:43
that punchdown block this greatly
6:45
simplifies cable management because we
6:47
know that cable between the desk and the
6:49
closet is never going to move but there
6:51
may be times where a person in one desk
6:53
may need to connect to a different
6:55
switch or a different VLAN for that
6:57
reason on the other side of the patch
6:59
panel we may have RJ45 connectors where
7:02
we can move things around whenever we'd
7:04
like for example we might plug into a
7:07
particular switch using those RJ45
7:10
connectors on the patch panel but if we
7:12
ever need to change any of these
7:14
connections we leave the entire run
7:16
between the desk and the patch panel in
7:18
place and we simply change where things
7:20
are plugged in on the other side of the
7:23
patch panel if you need connectivity to
7:25
a different switch or a different VLAN
7:27
you can do all of that from inside the
7:29
closet without ever touching that
7:31
extended connection between the desk and
7:34
the closet itself here's one side of a
7:36
patch panel you can see there are
7:38
different connections coming from the
7:39
desks and they're numbered so that we
7:41
know exactly what desk that cable is
7:43
going to that connection to the desk is
7:45
probably punched down on the other side
7:47
of this connector and then there's the
7:49
RJ45 connectors on our side that we
7:52
would then use to connect to a switch
7:54
interface this is why we have permanent
7:56
connections between the desk and the
7:58
closet so we know that that Ethernet
8:00
connection is always going to be static
8:03
and will be unlikely to have any type of
8:05
wiring issue and on the inside of our
8:07
closet we can change this configuration
8:10
anytime we'd like with a relatively
8:12
short cable that we could swap out if we
8:14
ever run into a problem this also allows
8:16
us to extend the functionality inside of
8:19
our closet to add or remove different
8:21
switches and then we simply connect to
8:23
different interfaces using this side of
8:25
the patch panel here's a very simplified
8:28
view of this where we have a patch panel
8:30
at the top coming from desk 9 desk 10
8:32
desk 11 and you can see a very short
8:34
cable is used to then connect those
8:36
desks to the appropriate interface on
8:38
the network switch
8:40
another important device especially for
8:43
our security is a firewall a traditional
8:46
firewall makes decisions about allowing
8:49
or disallowing traffic based on the port
8:51
number of traffic that's traversing the
8:53
firewall so a firewall will look at the
8:55
TCP or UDP port number and then compare
8:58
that to a set of access lists inside of
9:01
the firewall that determine whether that
9:03
traffic is allowed or disallowed our
9:06
more modern firewalls are next
9:08
generation firewalls and they make these
9:10
forwarding decisions based on the
9:12
application in use so a firewall might
9:14
allow web traffic to traverse the
9:16
firewall but block any type of remote
9:18
access software that decision is not
9:21
being made based on the port number but
9:22
is instead looking at the application
9:24
traffic itself many firewalls can also
9:28
be used as a VPN concentrator so you can
9:30
use this as a frontend to have sight
9:32
to-sightVPNs or have it as a centralized
9:35
concentrator for remote access VPNs some
9:38
firewalls might also act as a proxy
9:40
where they sit in the middle of a
9:42
conversation take a request from a
9:44
client pass that request on to the
9:46
server examine the response from the
9:48
server and only then provide that data
9:50
back to the client and in many
9:52
organizations these firewalls are
9:54
installed as routers so not only are
9:56
they providing this security function
9:58
they're also routing between different
10:00
IP subnets and on larger firewalls you
10:03
might have many different interfaces
10:04
where you can connect tens or even
10:07
hundreds of networks to each other all
10:09
managed and controlled through the
10:10
security built into this
10:13
firewall our Ethernet networks used to
10:15
pass only data through those wires but
10:18
these days we can include data and power
10:21
over the same wire all running over that
10:23
Ethernet connection we refer to this as
10:25
power over Ethernet or PoE we often use
10:29
PoE to power our telephones on our desk
10:32
any type of access point that we would
10:33
hang on the ceiling or any other devices
10:36
that connect to this network this can
10:38
certainly simplify the process of
10:40
installing some of these components
10:42
especially when you have wireless access
10:44
points that are in difficult places to
10:46
get to in the ceiling you would only
10:48
need to run a single Ethernet connection
10:50
that is providing both the data and the
10:52
power for that access point many
10:54
switches have power over Ethernet built
10:56
into the switch itself but if your
10:58
switch doesn't support any type of PoE
11:01
you can use an injector like the one you
11:03
see here you would disconnect your
11:04
Ethernet cable put the injector in the
11:07
middle and then plug the injector into a
11:09
power source to provide PoE over that
11:12
connection when the PoE power is coming
11:14
from the switch itself we refer to that
11:16
as an inspan and if you're using an
11:18
injector it's referred to as a midspan
11:22
if you're not sure if your switch
11:23
supports PoE it's usually marked on the
11:25
switch itself on this switch you can see
11:27
it does have a PoE and it shows that all
11:30
of the interfaces that are marked in
11:32
blue can be used for power over Ethernet
11:35
you might also look at your switch
11:37
documentation to see what type of PoE is
11:40
supported the one that is simply PoE is
11:42
the original PoE specification that
11:45
provides 15.4 4 watts of DC power over a
11:48
maximum current of 350 milliamps that
11:52
original specification was great for
11:54
powering things like phones and other
11:56
smaller devices but we quickly found
11:58
that we needed a bit more power for our
12:00
remote devices that's why we created PoE
12:03
Plus that's 25.5 watts of DC power with
12:07
a maximum current of 600 milliamps with
12:10
PoE Plus we can connect larger devices
12:12
that require a bit more power things
12:14
like a pan tilt and zoom camera for
12:17
example and these days we can use PoE to
12:20
even power our laptops with
12:22
PoE++ that's 51 watts at 600 milliamps
12:26
current or 71.3 watts with 960 milliamps
12:31
current depending on the capabilities of
12:33
your switch poe++ is the version that
12:36
was introduced with 10 gig Ethernet
12:38
running over copper cables and although
12:41
these PoE standards are downward
12:43
compatible they obviously are not
12:45
upwards compatible for example if you
12:47
have a device that needs a lot of power
12:49
for example it needs a PoE++ type
12:52
connection you will not be able to power
12:54
that device with PoE plus or lower this
12:57
allows you to power many different types
12:59
of devices on your network without
13:01
having to worry about wiring where the
13:04
power may be coming from or changing
13:06
anything with your Ethernet network
13:09
if your internet connection comes from a
13:11
traditional cable television provider
13:13
then you're probably getting your data
13:15
connection from a cable modem this uses
13:18
a broadband connection usually provided
13:20
over coax link and that is providing an
13:23
Ethernet connection on the other side so
13:26
we're able to connect to the same
13:27
network that sends our television
13:29
signals and also send our data across
13:32
that same line you'll sometimes see
13:34
these cable modem devices referred to as
13:37
a DOCIS device this is referring to the
13:39
standard used to transmit that signal
13:42
across the cable network this is
13:44
referring to data over cable service
13:46
interface specification we commonly see
13:49
1 gig communication and higher on these
13:52
cable modem connections and this is
13:54
something that is a common connection
13:56
for people that already have cable
13:58
television in their home and since you
14:00
are getting such high throughputs over
14:02
these connections it's also very common
14:04
to see these in a corporate environment
14:06
as well although you may not even be
14:08
using the television or the voice
14:10
communication having that high-speed
14:12
data on a cable modem can be very
14:14
valuable in almost any data
14:16
center not everyone has the connectivity
14:19
of a cable network so instead you may be
14:21
using a traditional telephone network
14:24
and you can run a digital internet
14:26
connection over that using DSL or
14:28
digital subscriber line this uses the
14:31
same wires that you use for your analog
14:33
telephone but also sends digital signals
14:36
across it at the same time dsl can give
14:39
you reasonably good throughput as well
14:41
it's not uncommon to see 200 megabits
14:43
downstream and 20 megabits upstream on
14:46
many DSL networks that throughput is
14:49
affected by your distance from the
14:50
central office and there is a limitation
14:53
of approximately 10,000 ft you have to
14:55
be sure that that central office is at
14:57
least somewhat close to where you will
14:59
be connecting to the network because of
15:01
that you'll find the closer you get to
15:03
the central office the faster the
15:05
download and upload speeds will be on
15:07
this DSL
15:08
network you might be lucky enough to
15:11
have fiber that's in the ground outside
15:13
of your home or office and in that case
15:15
you may connect to that network using
15:18
an optical network terminal that
15:21
converts the fiber coming into your home
15:23
or business into copper connections that
15:25
you can use on a traditional network
15:27
this device is usually in a central
15:30
place or a demarcation point or demark
15:33
this may be in the data center itself or
15:35
it may be in a box that's on the outside
15:37
or just inside of your building we refer
15:40
to this as the demarcation point because
15:42
this is where we determine what part of
15:45
the network is the responsibility of the
15:47
user and what part of the network is the
15:49
responsibility of the service provider
15:51
this effectively creates that
15:53
demarcation point so that any of the
15:56
wiring on the inside of your building is
15:57
your responsibility but any problems
15:59
with the network outside of your
16:01
building are the responsibility of your
16:03
internet service provider here's a
16:05
better view of this there's a fiber
16:08
connection coming into this link that's
16:09
on the NT and you can see there's not
16:12
only RJ11 connections that would be used
16:14
for voice communication this is probably
16:16
a voice over IP that has phone numbers
16:19
associated with it and there's also a
16:21
data connection that has an RJ45
16:23
connector and that's probably outputting
16:25
an Ethernet link that you could then
16:26
plug into a router this can also be used
16:29
for video so you'll notice there's an F
16:31
connector on this as well that you can
16:33
plug in a coax connector that would then
16:35
go to a cable box or directly to a
16:39
television and of course we'll
16:41
eventually need to connect devices and
16:43
servers directly to the Ethernet network
16:45
and we do that by using a network
16:47
interface card or a nick this is what we
16:50
have built into system boards that are
16:52
in our laptops and desktop systems or we
16:55
might have a separate interface card
16:57
like the one you see here that can
16:58
provide multiple Ethernet connections on
17:01
a single card there are many different
17:03
types of network interface cards you
17:05
could get one for a 100 megbit Ethernet
17:07
a gig Ethernet over copper maybe this
17:10
network interface card has fiber
17:12
connectors on the back of it so you'll
17:13
need to make sure you're using the right
17:15
kind of network interface card for the
17:17
network that you're connecting to these
17:20
separate expansion cards allow you to
17:22
extend the functionality of your
17:23
existing device if there's no Ethernet
17:26
connection on your motherboard you can
17:27
add Ethernet connections that way even
17:30
if there is an Ethernet connection built
17:32
into the motherboard you can add
17:34
additional Ethernet interfaces by simply
17:36
adding one of these expansion cards and
17:39
since this is an Ethernet device each
17:41
one of these interfaces has its own
17:42
media access control address or MAC
17:45
address so that we can individually
17:47
reference each of these interfaces
17:49
across the network
