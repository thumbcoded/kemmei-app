You are to generate exam-quality flashcards for the CompTIA A+ 220-1201, domain 4.0, subdomain 4.1, concept: Virtual machine purposes and use cases, using the following files:

- transcript.txt: Raw source material for card creation  
- covmap.json: Concept definitions and required terms  
- bulk-template.txt: Reference card schema and required fields

Instructions:

1. Read all three files in full before generating any cards.
2. For each concept listed in covmap.json for this subdomain:
    - Cover the entire concept at each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
    - Each difficulty level must independently cover all key ideas and terms for the concept, using appropriate depth and complexity.
    - Do NOT treat Easy/Medium/Hard as progressive layers. Each level must stand on its own with full concept coverage.
    - Do NOT default to a fixed number of cards per concept or per difficulty. Let the concept’s depth and the transcript determine the number of cards.
    - Use a variety of question types (multiple_choice, select_multiple, select_all) unless the concept is extremely shallow.
        - For select_multiple, the question text must specify how many to select.
        - For select_all, use only if all listed options are correct, and include "(Select all that apply)" in the question.
    - If a difficulty level is not justified by the concept’s depth, explicitly state this in your notes.
    - Each card must include at least one tag that matches verbatim a term from the concept’s "terms" list in covmap.json.
      ✱ Tags must match character-for-character — no formatting changes, hyphens, alternate punctuation, or inferred variations are allowed.
      ✱ Tags not found in the "terms" list must be omitted.
      ✱ Do not rely on semantic equivalents, synonyms, or “helpful” reformulations.

✅ After generating cards, explicitly validate every tags[] field against the covmap list before submitting output. Reject or revise any card with a non-compliant tag.

    - Use the card structure and field requirements from bulk-template.txt. Do NOT include the `_id` field — it will be auto-generated by the backend.
    - All cards must be posted as a single JSON code snippet.

3. Prioritize quality and coverage over quantity.

4. Do not rely on memory between sessions; always re-read the files.

Begin by generating Easy cards for the first concept. Wait for confirmation before proceeding to Medium and Hard.

If you need clarification or a clean template, ask before generating cards.
