I'll analyze the coverage by reading all the relevant files and evaluating the representation of topics and checking for repetitions. Now let me read the covmap for subdomain 1.1: Now let me analyze the questions file to check coverage and identify any repetitions. I'll read the entire file systematically: ## Coverage Analysis Summary

Based on my analysis of the transcript, covmap, and questions file, here's the comprehensive evaluation:

### 1. **Coverage by Concept (14 concepts total)**

**Excellent Coverage (10+ questions each):**
- **Battery modularity** (10 questions) - Well covered
- **Battery types and features** (10 questions) - Well covered  
- **Keyboard replacement** (10 questions) - Well covered
- **Individual key repair** (10 questions) - Well covered
- **Memory upgradeability** (10 questions) - Well covered
- **Storage device types** (11 questions) - Well covered
- **Drive replacement procedures** (10 questions) - Well covered
- **Drive cloning and migration** (10 questions) - Well covered
- **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth interfaces** (10 questions) - Well covered
- **Antenna placement** (10 questions) - Well covered
- **Biometric authentication** (9 questions) - Good coverage
- **NFC usage** (9 questions) - Good coverage
- **Built-in cameras and mics** (9 questions) - Good coverage
- **Laptop troubleshooting fundamentals** (14 questions) - Excellent coverage

### 2. **Repetition Analysis**

**No Direct Repetitions Found:** All 141 questions are unique in their wording and focus different aspects or scenarios within each concept area.

**Appropriate Variation:** Questions within each concept cover:
- Basic knowledge questions
- Scenario-based troubleshooting
- Multi-step procedures
- Comparative analysis
- Best practices

### 3. **Tag Alignment with Covmap**

**Excellent Tag Coverage:** All questions use tags that align perfectly with the terms defined in the covmap.json for subdomain 1.1. Examples:
- Battery questions use tags like `modular battery`, `user-swappable battery`, `lithium ion`, `battery form factor`
- Storage questions use `M.2`, `SSD`, `HDD`, `cloning software`, `drive migration`
- Wireless questions use `802.11`, `Wi-Fi card`, `Bluetooth`, `antenna wire`, `wrap around display`

### 4. **Transcript Coverage Assessment**

**Complete Coverage:** Every major topic from the transcript is well-represented:
- ✅ Introduction to laptop maintenance (14 questions)
- ✅ Battery modularity and types (20 questions total)
- ✅ Keyboard replacement and repair (20 questions total) 
- ✅ Memory upgradeability (10 questions)
- ✅ Storage devices and procedures (21 questions total)
- ✅ Wireless interfaces and antennas (20 questions total)
- ✅ Biometric authentication (9 questions)
- ✅ NFC usage (9 questions)
- ✅ Built-in cameras and microphones (9 questions)

### 5. **Quality Assessment**

**Strengths:**
- All 14 concepts from covmap are covered
- Balanced distribution across difficulty levels
- Scenario-based questions test practical application
- No repetitive content
- Tags align perfectly with covmap terms
- Questions reflect real-world troubleshooting situations

**Overall Assessment:** ✅ **EXCELLENT COVERAGE**
