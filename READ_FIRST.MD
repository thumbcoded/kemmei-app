## ü™∂ Facts & Disclaimers

**Why**  

Kemmei began as a personal experiment in building a self-testing app that could persist individual results ‚Äî something I found missing when using ChatGPT‚Äôs built-in memory at the time.  
Back then, it would forget which questions I had answered correctly and repeat items unpredictably.  
Whether that has improved since (early 2025) I can‚Äôt say, but I decided to build such an app anyway.

As a result, I learned a great deal about web development from scratch ‚Äî HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî along with IDE workflows, debugging, QA, git, and how to collaborate effectively with large-language models.

Kemmei‚Äôs broader goal is to explore how structured learning tools can be generated and refined with modern AI assistance.

**Expectations**  

This is a niche, hobby-level project with no commercial ambitions and very modest expectations of popularity.  
If it somehow grows into a useful or popular tool, I may consider expanding it and covering additional certification titles.  
For now, it is published primarily for transparency, curiosity, and for anyone who might find it educational or inspiring.

**Authorship and process**  

Most of the source code and card content were written with the assistance of large-language models (LLMs) under human supervision.  
The human author handled concept design, architecture, QA, and testing, ensuring the output is coherent and safe to use.  
No proprietary or copyrighted third-party material was used.
