0:02
you have a mobile phone you probably
0:03
also refer to it as your cell phone that
0:06
term cell comes from the cellular
0:08
networks that we use to be able to
0:10
communicate using these phones these
0:13
operate by having antennas that separate
0:16
areas of the land into what we're
0:18
calling cells they're antennas that
0:20
allow us coverage inside of those cells
0:23
using a number of different frequencies
0:25
and all of that together makes up our
0:27
cellular networks these cellular
0:30
networks provide both voice and data
0:32
communication and you get to decide how
0:35
that information is used by your mobile
0:36
device for example you can turn on and
0:39
off the cellular data functionality and
0:41
perhaps only use this as voice
0:44
communication or you may be familiar
0:46
with airplane mode that disables all of
0:48
the communication on this device and
0:50
then you can pick and choose which ones
0:52
you'd like to turn on
0:54
cellular technology really started
0:56
taking off with 3G technology in 1998 3g
1:00
allowed us to send and receive larger
1:03
amounts of data over these networks
1:05
which means that we were able to
1:07
increase the capabilities of our mobile
1:09
devices this allowed us to have GPS
1:11
functionality which we'll talk more
1:13
about in a moment we have mobile
1:14
television video on demand video
1:16
conferencing and other data related
1:19
services all enabled thanks to 3G we
1:22
then upgraded from 3G into the 4G
1:25
technologies sometimes we refer to these
1:27
as long-term evolution or LTE 4g is
1:32
based on a technology called GSM which
1:34
is the global system for mobile
1:36
communications sometimes you may hear
1:38
this referred to as edge or the enhanced
1:40
data rates for GSM evolution this
1:43
allowed us to have bandwidths up to 150
1:46
megabits per second so we were able to
1:48
take those data capabilities in 3G and
1:51
expand on them with 4G we were then able
1:54
to upgrade LTE to LTE advanced or LTEA
1:59
that standard allowed throughputs of up
2:01
to 300 megabits per second greatly
2:04
increasing the amount of data we could
2:05
send over these networks and our modern
2:08
mobile networks use our fifth generation
2:11
of networking or 5G 5g was introduced in
2:15
2020 and it greatly improved the
2:17
bandwidth that we were able to push over
2:19
these networks this 5G technology over
2:21
higher frequencies is designed to
2:23
support up to 10 Gbits per second and if
2:26
you're running over other frequencies
2:28
with 5G you could have 100 to 900
2:30
megabits per second of total throughput
2:33
having that much bandwidth available for
2:35
a single device changes how we're able
2:37
to use these devices for example
2:39
Internet of Things or IoT now allows
2:43
much more functionality because we're
2:45
not constrained by the amount of
2:46
bandwidth that we could send so we're
2:48
able to take these Internet of Things
2:50
devices over these 5G networks and
2:53
instantly send large amounts of data
2:55
over these wireless networks this allows
2:57
us to get notifications faster we can
3:00
transmit and receive much more data
3:02
which allows us to send a lot more into
3:04
the cloud for
3:05
processing just as our cellular
3:08
technologies have increased in speed and
3:10
function we have also had similar
3:12
increases with 802.11 wireless these are
3:16
high-speed 802.11 networks that we
3:18
commonly use at home and in our offices
3:21
this allows us to have very high-speed
3:23
throughput without any type of wired
3:26
connection these do have a limited range
3:28
however and we have a local access point
3:30
that everyone connects to to be able to
3:32
gain access to the 802.11 network this
3:35
Wi-Fi functionality enables voice video
3:38
data and almost any other type of data
3:41
transfer this 802.11 network provides
3:44
functionality for many different types
3:46
of applications and many mobile phones
3:48
allow you to communicate voice
3:50
communication over the 802.11 network so
3:54
if you're in an area where your 4G or 5G
3:57
network doesn't have very good signal
3:59
you could use that phone over your Wi-Fi
4:02
network this allows you to receive and
4:04
send calls just as if you were connected
4:06
to a 4G or 5G
4:09
network we can also turn our mobile
4:11
phones into an internet router and have
4:13
multiple devices use our phone for
4:16
internet access we refer to this as
4:18
hotspot functionality our phone is
4:20
connecting to the cellular network using
4:22
5G and then other devices are connecting
4:25
to our phone over 802.11 this means that
4:28
you can take your phone anywhere and
4:30
have everyone use your phone for
4:32
internet access this is something that
4:34
is commonly built into the operating
4:37
systems and functionality of our
4:39
existing mobile phones but it does
4:41
require that your carrier enable or
4:43
allow that functionality not all
4:45
carriers do and sometimes there's an
4:48
extra charge so make sure you check with
4:50
your mobile carrier to see what options
4:52
might be available for you one way that
4:54
your mobile carrier is able to recognize
4:57
your mobile device is through the use of
4:59
a subscriber identity module or a SIM
5:02
this is sometimes a physical card that's
5:05
inside of your mobile phone and it
5:07
contains all of the information that
5:09
identifies what your phone is on that
5:11
mobile network this means that you could
5:13
potentially take that SIM out of your
5:15
phone put it in a different phone and
5:18
now you've moved your number to a
5:20
different physical device that SIM
5:22
contains information about the carrier
5:24
that you're using and the subscriber
5:26
which is you the user of the phone it
5:28
has a SIM ID and a phone number
5:30
associated with it it contains the
5:32
information about that cellular network
5:34
that you're connected to and there's
5:36
storage space on the SIM itself that
5:38
allows you to store contacts and
5:39
messages on the SIM so when you move the
5:42
SIM from one phone to another you can
5:44
also move those contacts and messages
5:46
newer phones no longer use a physical
5:49
SIM card but instead use an electronic
5:51
version or embedded SIM sometimes you'll
5:54
see this as an eSIM that eSIM is a
5:58
physical part of that phone and can't be
6:00
physically unplugged and plugged into a
6:02
new phone but you can move that SIM
6:05
inside of that device using the software
6:08
on the phone so if you'd like to add or
6:10
move an eSIM into the phone that you're
6:12
using you can choose the option to add
6:15
an eSIM and it gives you then options on
6:17
how you might want to transfer that from
6:19
an existing phone or to use a QR code
6:21
for the transfer having that ESIM makes
6:25
it so much easier to manage that
6:27
transfer between devices if you've ever
6:29
dealt with a SIM which is the physical
6:32
card you can see that they're very small
6:34
you often need a special tool to be able
6:36
to unplug or disconnect those and you
6:38
can see that this phone supports
6:40
multiple SIMs simultaneously so that you
6:42
could have multiple phone numbers or
6:44
profiles on the same mobile phone
6:47
device if you've ever had to connect a
6:49
Bluetooth device such as a headset or an
6:51
external speaker then you know there's a
6:54
process you have to go through to make
6:55
sure that those two devices are paired
6:57
successfully this is not only a process
7:00
that ensures security but it also makes
7:02
sure that you're able to connect to that
7:04
device automatically later on this
7:06
process commonly uses a personal
7:08
identification number or a PIN to verify
7:11
the connectivity when you set it up
7:12
initially and fortunately you only have
7:15
to go through this pairing process one
7:16
time for a piece of hardware once it's
7:19
paired you can connect and disconnect
7:21
from that Bluetooth device and you don't
7:23
have to go through this pairing process
7:24
every single time although the Bluetooth
7:27
pairing process is very similar between
7:29
devices there may be nuances or
7:32
differences depending on the device
7:34
you're connecting to so check your
7:36
documentation to make sure you know the
7:37
appropriate personal identification
7:39
number or where you would find that
7:41
information on your Bluetooth device you
7:44
would start the pairing process by
7:45
enabling Bluetooth on both of the
7:47
devices that will connect to each other
7:49
if you're an iOS or Android user you'll
7:52
find this enable and disable function
7:54
under settings and Bluetooth you would
7:56
then set both of those devices to be
7:59
discoverable by each other this may
8:01
require a specific key sequence or
8:03
startup process so make sure you check
8:06
your Bluetooth device documentation to
8:08
know how to put your device into a
8:10
discoverable mode once you do this
8:12
you'll see devices start to appear on
8:15
your mobile device and then you can
8:17
select that to begin the pairing process
8:19
before the pairing process completes it
8:21
asks you to confirm a personal
8:23
identification number this might be one
8:26
that is embedded into the Bluetooth
8:27
device or it may be dynamic so that it
8:30
changes every time you try to pair with
8:32
that device again your documentation
8:34
will tell you where to find that PIN and
8:36
you'll need to confirm that PIN or type
8:38
it in on one of those Bluetooth devices
8:41
at that point the Bluetooth pairing
8:42
process is complete and those two
8:44
devices can communicate with each other
8:46
you can test this by powering down one
8:48
of those devices powering it back up and
8:50
making sure that it's able to
8:52
automatically reconnect over the
8:54
Bluetooth
8:55
connection if you've ever used the maps
8:57
functionality on your mobile phone then
8:59
you know the GPS capability can be very
9:01
helpful gps is the global positioning
9:04
system and it's a technology that was
9:06
created by the United States Department
9:08
of Defense this technology uses
9:10
satellites that are circling the Earth
9:12
and if you can see four of those
9:14
satellites with your phone then you'll
9:16
get accurate GPS readings this GPS
9:18
functionality uses differences in the
9:21
signal that is received from these
9:22
multiple satellites to determine your
9:25
longitude your latitude and the altitude
9:28
above sea level so if you're using maps
9:30
or you're using an app that has location
9:32
functionality it may be using GPS to
9:35
determine that but GPS is not the only
9:38
way to determine where you are some apps
9:40
use the Wi-Fi networks that are around
9:42
you to get a better idea of where you
9:44
might be even if GPS is not currently
9:47
available and some cellular networks are
9:49
able to triangulate based on the
9:51
different cellular towers to determine
9:53
where you might be as well so if you are
9:55
having a problem communicating or
9:57
receiving GPS signals you may be able to
9:59
use these other technologies to locate
10:02
where you might be


0:02
if you have an organization and you need
0:03
to manage all of the mobile phones used
0:06
in the organization then you need a
0:08
mobile device manager or MDM this allows
0:12
you to manage devices that may be owned
0:14
by your company or devices that are
0:16
personally owned this would be a b yod
0:19
where someone is bringing their own
0:21
device to use at work when that occurs
0:24
you need some way to be able to
0:26
centrally manage all of your mobile
0:28
devices from one place this is a
0:31
relatively specialized function and so
0:33
you need specialized software to be able
0:35
to do this an MDM allows you as the
0:37
system administrator to set certain
0:39
rules and parameters on how these mobile
0:41
devices are used so you could set
0:43
policies on which applications are
0:45
allowed or not allowed you can configure
0:48
or disable functionality of things like
0:50
your camera or GPS and effectively
0:53
control almost every aspect of these
0:56
mobile devices this also allows you as a
0:59
company to set up a partitioned area on
1:02
someone's personal phone for use by the
1:05
organization this allows your users to
1:07
have their own private data that is
1:09
protected and private to them and have a
1:11
different part of the phone that is
1:13
partitioned off just for corporate data
1:16
and from a security perspective you can
1:18
require the use of certain security
1:20
policies for example you may require
1:22
everyone in your organization to use
1:24
screen locks and those screen locks need
1:26
to have a personal identification number
1:28
or other type of access in order to
1:31
unlock that phone BYOD is a interesting
1:35
challenge for organizations this of
1:37
course stands for bring your own device
1:39
you may see this also referred to as
1:41
bring your own technology the employee
1:44
owns the phone and since they already
1:46
have a phone that simplifies things for
1:48
the employee so that they don't have to
1:49
carry around two different mobile
1:51
devices but we need to have some way to
1:54
protect the company data that is stored
1:56
in that phone and to make sure that all
1:58
the users personal information remains
2:00
personal and private this allows you to
2:03
configure from the mobile device manager
2:05
what part of that device is home or
2:07
private and what part of that device is
2:09
used for work purposes you can also set
2:12
different parameters for how the data is
2:14
protected on that device and you also
2:16
need to set policies on what happens to
2:18
the data on that device if the phone is
2:21
upgraded traded in or if the phone is
2:24
lost some organizations don't allow user
2:27
phones to be used inside of the company
2:30
instead the company will provide the
2:32
phones through cope this is corporate
2:34
owned personally enabled the company
2:38
purchases the phone they assign that
2:40
phone to a user and then they manage
2:42
that as a corporate device although the
2:44
corporation does have full control of
2:46
that device in many organizations they
2:48
allow the user to use it as a personal
2:51
device as well since the company is
2:53
purchased the phone they have complete
2:55
control over the phone and they manage
2:57
every aspect of how that particular
2:59
device managed this is very similar to
3:02
how organizations might manage laptops
3:04
desktops and other Computing devices the
3:07
company determines how information is
3:09
stored on the device what type of
3:11
information is stored on the device or
3:13
perhaps more importantly what happens to
3:15
that data if the device is changed out
3:18
or if the device is lost some
3:20
organizations will add some flexibility
3:22
to the process and allow the user to
3:25
choose from a selection of devices we
3:28
refer to that as CYO or choose your own
3:32
device having management of all of your
3:34
mobile devices from a central MDM policy
3:37
screen provides a lot of flexibility and
3:40
saves a lot of time for example you can
3:42
configure your Corporate email settings
3:44
on the mobile device manager that's
3:46
pushed down to everyone's phone and so
3:49
they don't have to make any changes at
3:51
all to gain access to their inbox they
3:53
simply turn on their phone and
3:55
everything works as it should the
3:57
security team may decide that they would
3:59
like additional Security on these mobile
4:01
devices since they are outside of the
4:03
company and can be lost easily so they
4:05
may require things like two-factor
4:07
authentication and they can specify what
4:10
type of multiactor authentication they
4:12
would like and from the MDM you can
4:14
determine what applications are allowed
4:17
on that device if there are certain
4:18
applications that are forbidden to be
4:20
installed on that device and you can
4:22
even push those applications to be
4:24
installed
4:26
automatically here's a view from an MDM
4:28
console we can see that we are looking
4:30
at a number of devices inside of the
4:32
organization we can see the device name
4:35
the platform that it uses we can see
4:37
usernames associated with that phone and
4:39
even know the email and contact
4:41
information for the phone and if you
4:43
need the IMI which is a unique
4:46
identifier that's also listed in the
4:48
mobile device manager you can drill down
4:51
on one of those devices to get more
4:52
information about it for example this is
4:54
an Apple iOS device specifically an
4:57
iPhone 13 you can see the version of I
4:59
OS that's being used we also have
5:01
information about the operating system
5:03
running on that device different device
5:05
Security Options that may be enabled or
5:07
disabled and you can see the network
5:09
summary that's currently in use for that
5:11
particular unit if we click over on the
5:13
restrictions tab you can see all of the
5:16
settings that you can enable or disable
5:19
since you are the manager of this
5:21
particular phone you can enable or
5:23
disable the camera FaceTime you can
5:25
change if voice dialing is enabled or
5:27
disabled if you want to get rid of Siri
5:30
you can turn that off inside of the MDM
5:32
and different Security Options printing
5:34
options and application options are also
5:37
configured from this restriction
5:40
screen the MDM also allows you to
5:43
configure how this device will be
5:44
synchronized over the air since these
5:46
devices are rarely plugged into a
5:49
central facility we need some way to
5:51
back up the data that's being stored on
5:53
these mobile phones some of these
5:55
settings are already preconfigured for
5:57
example your telephone information and
5:59
message mesages is something that we
6:00
know will always be configured and set
6:03
up on these devices but different
6:05
organizations might use different types
6:07
of email one organization might use
6:09
Gmail another organization might use
6:11
Microsoft Outlook each organization does
6:14
things a different way with different
6:16
settings and so the MDM allows you to
6:18
have all of those configured in one
6:20
central place it also allows you to turn
6:22
on how the data will be synchronized you
6:25
can specify whether data will be
6:27
synchronized over the Wi-Fi network only
6:29
or if it will use the cellular network
6:31
as well this is also important for
6:33
understanding how this data will also be
6:35
restored if this device fails is damaged
6:38
or you need to replace it you can also
6:41
get into the granular settings of the
6:43
synchronization for example you can
6:45
specify what specific types of data will
6:48
be synchronized will we synchronize
6:50
calendar settings will we synchronize
6:52
contact details and we may want to even
6:54
change how the data is going to be
6:56
synchronized at different times of the
6:59
day for example some organizations may
7:01
not want to use the cellular network due
7:03
to cost limitations maybe you can only
7:06
synchronize this data if it's on an
7:08
802.11 or local network fortunately most
7:12
of our mobile devices have settings
7:14
where we can specify how much of this
7:16
cellular network can be used and for
7:18
what purposes you want to check with the
7:20
contract that you have with your
7:22
cellular provider to see how much data
7:24
would be allowed over this network and
7:27
at what particular time and you as the
7:29
the administrator could configure for
7:31
example if automatic downloads are
7:33
configured and if they are configured
7:35
what size applications can be downloaded
7:38
over the mobile
7:39
network when you're setting up business
7:42
applications on these devices you're
7:44
often configuring things like Outlook
7:46
email cloud storage and other services
7:49
you would commonly set those up in the
7:51
account setting of that device where you
7:53
would need to provide a username a
7:56
password or some other type of
7:58
authentication Factor from there you can
8:00
get even more granular control over
8:02
exactly what will be synchronized and
8:04
you can choose mail contacts calendars
8:07
reminders notes or other settings you
8:09
can also set this up to be different
8:11
from other services so your
8:13
synchronization settings for Microsoft
8:15
Exchange might be very different than
8:17
the synchronizations that you configure
8:19
for Google Mail
