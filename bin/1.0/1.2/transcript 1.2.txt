0:02
with every person you know and everyone
0:04
in your organization walking around with
0:06
a phone a tablet or even both of those
0:09
we need to have different ways to be
0:10
able to connect these devices back to
0:13
the computers and networks that we
0:15
normally use and of course it seems that
0:17
each device has a different way of
0:19
connecting and communicating back to
0:21
your computer in this video we'll look
0:23
at wired connectivity Wireless
0:25
connectivity and all of the different
0:27
standards and options that you might
0:28
have available on today's mobile devices
0:31
you'll find that these connections that
0:33
we use for these mobile devices are used
0:35
for more than simply charging the
0:37
battery we often might use them for
0:39
connectivity and synchronization of the
0:41
data on these devices you might want to
0:43
back up what's on that device or use it
0:46
as a way to identify that the device is
0:48
really
0:49
yours one of the most common ways to
0:51
connect these mobile devices is using
0:54
USB or the universal serial bus these
0:57
are standard connections that we've used
0:59
for years and years and of course the
1:01
connectors themselves have changed a bit
1:03
as time has gone on you'll find that
1:06
there are different types of connections
1:08
for USB for older devices you may find
1:10
the mini and micro USB plugs are very
1:13
popular these were certainly used on
1:15
older mobile devices but you may find
1:18
even devices in use today are still
1:20
using these very specific USB types you
1:23
may find of course that our mobile
1:24
devices are getting smaller and smaller
1:27
but these interfaces are made for a much
1:29
larger style of interface and although
1:32
many of our modern devices have migrated
1:34
away from the micro b plug or the mini B
1:37
plug you may still use the USB type a
1:40
connection to plug into your Computing
1:42
device like your desktop computer or
1:44
your laptop computer more modern devices
1:47
are still using the universal serial bus
1:50
but they're using a newer version
1:51
referred to as
1:53
USBC this describes this physical
1:55
connection of a USBC plug inside of this
1:58
connection are 24 pins and they have the
2:02
same style of connection regardless of
2:04
how you might plug it in this can easily
2:06
replace the older USB 2.0 connection all
2:10
the way up to the latest standard of USB
2:13
and we can even put different types of
2:15
signals on this wire even though they
2:17
are all using the same type of connector
2:19
as its physical interface for example
2:22
you might find that this USB connection
2:24
is used for more than just serial
2:26
connectivity you could see display port
2:28
HDMI and Thunderbolt all can use that
2:31
single connector to be able to transmit
2:33
video data and other information USBC
2:37
was designed to be a connector that's
2:39
easy to use because you can plug it in
2:41
in any orientation and it also supports
2:44
a higher speed than the older USB style
2:46
connectors that we used to
2:48
use if you're using an older mobile
2:50
device used by Apple you may not be
2:52
using a USB connection you may instead
2:55
be using a proprietary connection from
2:57
Apple known as a lightning connector
3:00
this lightning connector has eight pins
3:02
and it's commonly used for older iPhone
3:04
and iPad devices lightning was
3:07
introduced to resolve a number of
3:08
problems with the older USB connection
3:11
standard for example it supported a
3:13
higher power output so it could charge
3:15
your phones and your tablets a little
3:16
bit faster it can be inserted either way
3:19
so you don't have to keep moving the
3:20
connector back and forth and up and down
3:22
to try to find the right connection and
3:24
this relatively simple design made it
3:26
easy to be able to use this across many
3:28
different devices the challenge of
3:30
course is that you might be using or
3:32
supporting a number of different mobile
3:34
devices from a number of different
3:36
manufacturers so you may be walking
3:38
around with a lot of different connector
3:39
types and cables inside of your bag just
3:42
to be able to support all of these
3:44
different components this might change
3:46
going forward as we move towards a
3:48
single USBC connector type instead of
3:50
using these many and very different
3:54
connections if you want to communicate
3:56
wirelessly there are also a number of
3:58
options available on your mobile device
3:59
one of those options is NFC or near
4:02
field communication NFC is commonly used
4:05
to transmit a little bit of data over a
4:08
very short connection NFC is often built
4:10
into your phone your tablet and your
4:12
Smartwatch and it's often used as
4:14
payment systems for paying something at
4:16
a point of sale terminal or you might
4:18
use it as identification to be able to
4:20
gain access through a particular door or
4:23
to be able to transfer information from
4:25
one phone to another some organizations
4:28
might have a sensor on on the wall and
4:30
they use NFC in a watch or phone to be
4:33
able to act as an access control so
4:35
instead of walking around with an ID
4:37
card or a separate access card you could
4:39
simply use the phone that you're
4:41
carrying
4:42
anyway if you're using wireless headsets
4:45
or wireless keyboards and mice then
4:47
you're probably using Bluetooth
4:49
Bluetooth allows us to connect devices
4:51
over a high-speed Network at relatively
4:53
short distances often we refer to this
4:56
as a personal area network or a pan this
4:59
is is commonly used for devices that we
5:01
would personally use on that mobile
5:03
device things like tethering your
5:05
smartphone to be able to connect
5:06
wirelessly or using it to connect
5:08
wireless headphones or headsets all of
5:11
these types of Bluetooth Communications
5:13
are designed for the individual although
5:15
it is possible to connect multiple
5:17
phones and devices together using this
5:19
Bluetooth networking
5:21
technology another useful mobile
5:23
connection type is to use your mobile
5:25
phone as an internet router if we have
5:28
many people connecting to our mobile
5:30
phone for internet access we refer to
5:32
that as a hotspot if we simply have one
5:35
device that is connecting to this mobile
5:37
phone and that is the only device that's
5:38
able to use that phone we often refer to
5:41
that as tethering this is functionality
5:43
that's commonly associated with the
5:45
software in your phone and the
5:47
capabilities from your phone provider so
5:49
you may want to contact your mobile
5:51
provider for your telephone and find out
5:53
if a hotspot functionality is something
5:55
that you can use on your mobile device

0:02
many of us have used our fingers to be
0:04
able to manipulate the screen of our
0:06
mobile phones or our tablets but if you
0:09
need a more precise input method you
0:11
might want to use a stylus this digital
0:14
Stylus is like using a pencil or a pen
0:17
and you're able to get very granular and
0:19
fine control of that information on the
0:21
screen the stylus is usually connecting
0:24
to the device over Bluetooth so it's
0:26
wireless and you're often able to use
0:28
pressure sensitivity and the but buttons
0:30
on the device to enable different
0:32
functions you do have to make sure that
0:34
the stylus you're using is compatible
0:36
with the device you're connecting to so
0:38
if you're using an Apple laptop you have
0:40
to make sure that you're using the apple
0:42
pencil or something that is compatible
0:44
with that particular tablet this pairing
0:47
usually creates in the best possible
0:49
connection and enables the most number
0:51
of features for the person using that
0:53
tablet instead of holding your mobile
0:55
phone to your ear to be able to
0:57
communicate many people prefer to use a
0:59
handsfree headset this headset allows
1:01
you to hear and to talk into a
1:03
microphone so it makes it very easy to
1:05
have these phone conversations you might
1:08
use a wired headset many devices use USB
1:11
as a common headset type or you may use
1:13
the older analog connection over a trrs
1:17
connector this is a tip ring ring sleeve
1:20
connector it's commonly a 32 mm style
1:23
connector you might also hear this
1:25
referred to as an analog audio jack if
1:28
you're using an older model model of an
1:30
Apple iPhone instead of using USB you
1:32
may need to use lightning and there are
1:34
wired headsets available that have
1:36
lightning connectors at the end and of
1:39
course there are many options for
1:40
wireless headsets and most of those
1:42
headsets connect to your mobile device
1:44
using Bluetooth here's a closeup of that
1:47
analog audio jack or
1:49
trrs the trrs stands for tip ring ring
1:53
sleeve where the tip is the connection
1:55
that's on the tip of that connector and
1:58
the sleeve is the connector closest to
2:00
the back sleeve of the connector and
2:02
with a trrs there are two connectors in
2:05
the middle and these are both the ring
2:07
connectors wireless headsets of course
2:09
do not need any type of wires so you
2:12
might have something very simple that is
2:13
battery powered and connected to your
2:15
mobile device over Bluetooth if you use
2:17
that wireless headset all day you may
2:19
find that you run out of battery and you
2:21
might have to shift over to the wired
2:23
version of that
2:25
headset if you like to listen to music
2:27
on your mobile phone you may find that
2:29
the speakers on the phone don't provide
2:31
much Fidelity if that's the case for you
2:33
you might want to use wireless speakers
2:35
which provide a better sound over this
2:37
battery powered and portable speaker
2:39
system these are usually connected to
2:41
your mobile device wirelessly using
2:43
Bluetooth which allows you to take this
2:45
sound and move it anywhere you would
2:47
like within the range of that mobile
2:49
phone many of our phones and tablets
2:52
already include a camera or webcam built
2:55
into the device itself and many of our
2:57
laptops also provide that functionality
3:00
if you have a desktop or laptop that
3:02
does not have a camera or a webcam there
3:04
are options to include external
3:06
thirdparty cameras into that device
3:09
those will often connect to those
3:10
devices over a USB connection once you
3:13
connect the camera or enable it on your
3:15
mobile device you're now able to use it
3:17
in the applications so this might be for
3:19
simply capturing audio and video or you
3:22
might use it with an application to
3:24
provide video and audio
3:26
conferencing if you work in an office
3:28
and you like to take your lap laptop
3:30
home at night you may find yourself
3:31
unplugging all of the wires every day to
3:34
be able to take the laptop home and then
3:36
when you come back to the office you
3:37
have to plug all of those wires back in
3:39
again these would be wires for your
3:41
Video Connection your mouse your
3:43
keyboard perhaps your network link and
3:45
anything else that needs to be
3:47
physically connected there are easier
3:50
ways to perform that function using a
3:52
docking station docking stations are a
3:54
quick way to connect and disconnect the
3:56
laptop without having to touch any of
3:58
the cables that might on that desk they
4:01
also often provide additional interface
4:03
options and you might even be able to
4:05
plug in full-size interface Cards into
4:08
the docking station here's a docking
4:10
station that's in our office you can see
4:12
that we have a monitor and a keyboard
4:14
and a mouse probably have a network
4:16
connection on the back of this docking
4:18
station and we can simply bring our
4:19
laptop in place it on top of the docking
4:21
station and immediately start working at
4:24
the end of the day when we're ready to
4:25
leave we simply disconnect it from the
4:27
docking station and leave all of the
4:29
wires in place if you don't need support
4:32
for additional adapter cards and you
4:34
want something that's a bit more
4:35
portable you might want to use a port
4:38
replicator these are very similar to a
4:40
docking station but instead of getting a
4:42
very specific docking station for a
4:44
specific laptop these Port replicators
4:47
are commonly connecting over a USB
4:49
connection making it something that you
4:51
can use on almost any laptop or desktop
4:53
computer these are also relatively
4:55
portable because you don't have to worry
4:57
about them being very large and
4:59
supporting those adapter cards this port
5:01
replicator includes a lot of different
5:03
connectors including USB connections and
5:05
audio this one also supports micro SD
5:07
and SD card reader built into the port
5:10
replicator itself and on the other side
5:12
we have additional USB and video output
5:15
options as well if you're using a laptop
5:18
in a confined space you may find it
5:20
difficult to use an external Mouse for
5:22
that reason many Mouse functions are
5:24
built into today's laptops using a
5:27
trackpad the trackpad is usually large
5:29
area on the laptop that allows you to
5:31
use your fingers to be able to move the
5:33
mouse around without having an external
5:35
mouse that takes up even more room if
5:37
you like using the trackpad on your
5:39
laptop you can also use a trackpad on
5:41
your desktop with an external trackpad
5:44
these are usually battery powered and
5:45
they connect to your computer over a
5:47
Bluetooth connection unlike a
5:49
traditional Mouse a trackpad can provide
5:51
you with other features that perhaps a
5:54
mouse might not be able to do very
5:55
easily for example you can use different
5:58
finger options on the TR trackpad to
6:01
expand or contract different things on
6:02
the screen which would be relatively
6:05
difficult to do using a traditional
6:07
Mouse many laptops will allow you to
6:10
disable that trackpad using a function
6:12
key on this laptop you can use a
6:14
function F10 that you can see here with
6:17
the blue icon and that will enable or
6:19
disable the use of that trackpad that
6:22
way you can continue to use the keyboard
6:24
and know that you're not accidentally
6:26
going to click anything on the screen
6:27
from the trackpad
6:29
if you like using a stylus on your
6:31
tablet then you might want to use that
6:33
same technology on your laptop or
6:35
desktop computer and you can do that by
6:37
using a drawing pad this is an external
6:40
digitizer that has its own stylus to
6:43
give you the same precise input on a
6:45
desktop or laptop computer that you
6:47
might have on that tablet device this is
6:50
usually a third-party device that
6:51
connects to your computer over Bluetooth
6:54
or USB connection and allows for very
6:56
precise input so if you're someone who
6:59
enjoys using a stylus or you need it to
7:01
provide some type of artistic input this
7:03
might be a good solution for your laptop
7:05
or your desktop computer
