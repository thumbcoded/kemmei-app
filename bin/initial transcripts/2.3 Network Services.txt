here's an image of a pretty common data
0:04
center where you have rack after rack
0:06
after rack of equipment and you can see
0:09
there is a lot of equipment on one row
0:11
of this and there are many rows in this
0:14
particular data center there is a lot of
0:17
technology in this data center and there
0:18
are many different services running on
0:21
each of these individual racks in this
0:23
video we'll look at different services
0:25
that you might expect to find in a data
0:27
center like this one
0:29
we're all very used to typing in a
0:31
website into our browser address bar so
0:34
we might go to google.com or professor
0:36
messor.com but behind the scenes there
0:39
is some work done to convert that fully
0:41
qualified domain name to an IP address
0:44
the device that's doing that conversion
0:46
is a DNS server dns of course stands for
0:49
domain name system and it's responsible
0:51
not only for resolving an IP address
0:53
from a fully qualified domain name it
0:56
can also provide that same service in
0:58
reverse and provide much more as well
1:01
this is a distributed platform with
1:02
thousands and thousands of DNS servers
1:05
running on the internet at any
1:07
particular time and the load across
1:09
these DNS servers is distributed
1:12
primarily based on the domain names that
1:14
they support so there are a group of
1:16
servers that support professor
1:18
messor.com and anytime you type in my
1:21
website it accesses either those servers
1:23
or a cached version of information from
1:26
those servers to be able to provide you
1:28
with the appropriate IP address this is
1:30
something that's usually managed by your
1:32
service provider or you may have a
1:34
number of internal DNS servers that's
1:37
managed by your local organization
1:40
another important service is DHCP or
1:43
dynamic host configuration protocol this
1:46
is the protocol that's able to
1:48
automatically assign IP address and
1:50
other configuration settings anytime you
1:52
start your computer you don't have to
1:54
remember IP addresses or type anything
1:57
in dhcp will take care of all of that
2:00
work for you this is a widely used
2:02
service that you will see not only in a
2:04
local network at home but also the
2:06
networks that we would use in our
2:08
enterprise and in the enterprise we tend
2:10
to have multiple DHCP servers for
2:12
redundancy if one DHCP server is
2:15
suddenly unavailable we have other
2:17
servers that can still provide IP
2:19
address information for devices on the
2:22
network file sharing provides a way to
2:25
centrally store information so that you
2:28
and other people in the organization can
2:30
easily access it this is a great way to
2:32
share spreadsheets documents and
2:34
anything else that you need to share
2:36
with other people within your
2:37
organization or with people that may be
2:39
outside of your organization there's
2:42
usually a standard type of file service
2:44
if you're running in Windows you
2:46
probably have a service that is using
2:48
SMB or server message block if you have
2:51
Mac OS in your environment you're
2:53
probably using Apple filing protocol
2:55
there are many different standards for
2:56
sharing information and it depends on
2:58
the applications and the operating
3:00
systems that you happen to be using most
3:02
of the time you don't even know if
3:04
you're using SMB AFP or some other type
3:07
of file sharing system the operating
3:09
system tends to hide those protocols so
3:11
all you see is a file management
3:13
frontend where you can drag drop rename
3:16
and modify the files that are stored in
3:18
that folder
3:20
although a great deal of our work is
3:22
done digitally there are still times
3:24
when we need to print information onto a
3:26
piece of paper to be able to do that
3:28
we're going to use a printer but we need
3:30
some type of service that will manage
3:32
the process of receiving these print
3:34
jobs queuing them up inside of the
3:36
printer and then making sure that all of
3:38
those print jobs print successfully on
3:40
those printing devices sometimes this is
3:43
a separate computer that is connected to
3:45
the printer and that separate computer
3:46
is running the print service software or
3:49
it may be built into the printer itself
3:51
there may be a network card that you
3:53
slide in that card not only provides
3:55
your interface to the network it also
3:57
provides the print service software if
4:00
you were to look at the documentation
4:01
for your printer you'll probably see
4:03
that it supports a number of different
4:04
protocols for printing across the
4:06
network such as SMB which is server
4:09
message block IP which is the internet
4:11
printing protocol and LPD which is the
4:14
line printer
4:16
demon email continues to be one of the
4:19
most popular applications used around
4:21
the world and of course we need email
4:24
servers so that we can send and receive
4:26
these email messages these email servers
4:29
may be in the cloud and managed by your
4:31
internet service provider or cloud
4:33
service provider or you may have local
4:35
email servers in your own data center
4:37
that you're managing yourself this is
4:39
one of those rare services that has a
4:41
very high uptime expectation you always
4:44
expect your email to be flowing and you
4:46
always expect there to be access to your
4:48
email messages and as system
4:50
administrators we have to make sure that
4:52
we're planning designing and
4:54
implementing email services so that they
4:56
are available as much as
4:59
possible if you're managing switches
5:01
routers servers firewalls and almost any
5:04
other type of device on your network
5:07
then you're probably collecting log
5:08
files on all of those devices often
5:11
you'll want to consolidate all of those
5:13
log files back to one central database
5:16
and the protocol that allows you to do
5:17
that is SIS log there's usually a
5:20
central server called a SIM this stands
5:22
for security information and event
5:25
manager the SIM is a central
5:27
consolidation point for all of your log
5:30
files and it allows you to correlate
5:32
information together even across very
5:34
diverse systems since you're bringing
5:36
back a lot of log information to one
5:39
central point it's very common that your
5:41
SIS log server have a lot of log space
5:44
available because you will be keeping
5:46
logs for a very long time across many
5:48
different
5:50
systems if you're accessing information
5:52
from a browser then you're connecting to
5:54
a web server a web server is one that
5:57
responds to all of these browser
5:59
requests and generally is using the HTTP
6:02
or HTTPS protocol that of course is the
6:05
hypertext transfer protocol and
6:07
hypertext transfer protocol secure
6:10
developers build pages in a protocol
6:12
known as the hypertext markup language
6:15
or HTML and those are web files that are
6:18
stored on the web server your browser
6:20
accesses those files interprets the HTML
6:24
and presents to you the graphical
6:25
display in your browser
6:28
if you've ever connected to your
6:30
corporate network and provided your
6:31
username and password then you've
6:34
probably interacted with an
6:35
authentication server you'll sometimes
6:37
hear this referred to as a AAA server
6:39
which stands for authentication
6:41
authorization and accounting the primary
6:44
job of the authentication server is to
6:46
check your username and password and
6:48
then provide access to whatever services
6:50
you might need this usually has a
6:52
centralized database so that you can
6:54
easily administer all of the users on
6:56
your network all from one central point
6:59
you don't generally see an
7:00
authentication server on a home network
7:02
primarily because there's not a lot of
7:04
services that you would need to connect
7:06
to and secondly we usually will just use
7:08
a username password and share that among
7:11
our family members but in an enterprise
7:13
environment we have to provide the
7:14
highest levels of security and we do
7:16
that by making sure that everyone has
7:18
their own set of credentials since the
7:21
authentication server is an important
7:22
step to gain access to every other
7:24
resource in the organization we usually
7:27
create redundant authentication servers
7:29
so that if one happens to fail we're
7:31
still able to
7:33
authenticate most organizations are
7:35
collecting a lot of different types of
7:37
information and we need somewhere to
7:38
store that information one of the most
7:40
common places is a database server
7:43
database servers store information in
7:45
database tables you can think of these
7:47
tables as a very large spreadsheet and
7:49
they have the ability to connect tables
7:52
to each other to form a relational
7:54
database that way you can have separate
7:56
links where different types of data have
7:58
relationships to other types of data in
8:01
other tables this creates relationships
8:03
between different tables and allows you
8:05
to easily link data together and find
8:08
exactly what you're looking for a
8:10
standard language used to store and
8:13
retrieve information from this database
8:15
is known as structured query language
8:17
you'll hear this referred to as SQL or
8:19
SQL you'll see SQL mentioned in some of
8:22
the popular database servers such as
8:24
Microsoft SQL Server MySQL and
8:27
others have you noticed that the time
8:29
and the date on your computer is always
8:31
very accurate we're able to get that
8:33
level of accuracy because your computer
8:35
is talked to an NTP server or network
8:38
time protocol this is more important
8:40
than you might think because we use time
8:43
for so many different things on the
8:45
network not only to compare log files
8:47
across multiple systems but many of our
8:50
encryption technologies require that all
8:52
of your systems are running with the
8:54
correct date and the correct time we
8:56
will generally have one or more NTP
8:59
servers running they are referencing a
9:02
central clock so that all of them have
9:04
exactly the right date and time and then
9:06
on your local computer whether you're
9:08
running Windows Mac OS Linux or any
9:10
other operating system there is an NTP
9:13
client your NTP client is configured to
9:15
access a particular NTP server and it
9:18
checks in with that server periodically
9:20
to make sure that the date and time are
9:22
always
9:23
accurate all of us have received
9:25
unsolicited emails known as spam and
9:28
often we have a separate filter that
9:30
puts spam into a separate folder or
9:33
keeps it out of our inbox we're able to
9:36
perform that function thanks to a spam
9:38
gateway this is often a separate service
9:40
that's in the cloud or on a separate
9:42
server that evaluates every email
9:45
message that's coming in determines if
9:47
it might be legitimate or might be spam
9:50
and then categorizes it properly in your
9:52
email system you'll notice sometimes
9:54
that you have to go into your spam
9:56
folder to see if you can find legitimate
9:58
messages because this process is not
10:00
always 100% accurate this is an
10:03
important service that keeps the
10:05
unsolicited information away from your
10:07
eyes and allows you to focus on what's
10:09
important in your email
10:11
inbox many organizations will put an
10:14
all-in-one security appliance on the
10:17
outside of their network between them
10:19
and the internet sometimes we refer to
10:21
this as a next generation firewall a
10:23
unified threat management system or UTM
10:26
or perhaps a web security gateway these
10:29
devices have many different functions
10:32
all combined into one single device this
10:34
will have URL filtering or content
10:37
inspection it might be looking for
10:39
malware either in the email messages or
10:41
real-time network traffic it could have
10:43
a spam filter built into it it might
10:46
even have a CSU DSU for connecting to
10:48
older wide area network connections on
10:51
the back may be router and switch
10:53
interfaces along with firewall
10:55
functionality IPS functionality and even
10:58
ways to shape the bandwidth to minimize
11:01
the impact of certain applications on
11:03
the network and there might even be VPN
11:06
functionality that allows you to connect
11:07
securely to other sites or to have
11:09
endusers connect directly to this device
11:12
over a secure channel
11:15
one of the ways that organizations
11:17
maintain the uptime and availability of
11:19
their services is to have those services
11:21
running on a load balancer load
11:24
balancers are designed to connect many
11:26
different devices all at the same time
11:28
and be able to share the load across
11:31
those many systems so an organization
11:33
might build a web server farm with
11:35
multiple web servers and they have those
11:38
web servers connected to a load balancer
11:40
as incoming requests are received those
11:43
requests are distributed evenly across
11:45
all of those servers if one of those
11:47
servers was to fail the load balancer
11:50
would automatically know that that
11:51
server was no longer communicating and
11:54
would take it out of the rotation the
11:56
remaining devices on that load balancer
11:58
would then share the load with that
12:00
server now out of the picture this gives
12:02
the technicians time to evaluate the
12:05
problem resolve that issue and put the
12:07
server back onto the load balancer where
12:09
the load balancer will automatically
12:11
know that it's back in service and begin
12:13
sending additional requests to the
12:15
server now that it's up and running this
12:17
process occurs very quickly and the end
12:20
users have no idea that an outage even
12:23
occurred some organizations will take
12:26
advantage of a proxy server for either
12:28
inbound or outbound communication a
12:31
proxy server receives a request from a
12:33
client it then makes that request on
12:36
behalf of the client to that service
12:39
receives the response from that service
12:41
and evaluates the response if everything
12:44
within that response looks appropriate
12:46
and is secure it then now sends that
12:48
response to the end user this is
12:51
primarily used as a security tool but it
12:53
could also be used for access control it
12:56
can provide some level of caching it
12:58
also has the ability to do content
13:00
scanning so that you can limit what type
13:02
of information is able to be received
13:04
through that proxy server often the
13:06
proxy server is sitting invisibly in the
13:09
network and the end users have no idea
13:11
that there is a proxy that is evaluating
13:13
the inbound and outbound traffic from
13:16
their
13:17
device if you work in an organization
13:19
that has a lot of industrial equipment
13:21
then you're probably familiar with SCADA
13:23
or ICS scada is the supervisory control
13:26
and data acquisition system you might
13:29
also see this referred to as a
13:31
industrial control system or ICS so if
13:34
you work for a company that provides
13:36
power services maybe you work in the oil
13:38
and gas industry or a manufacturing
13:40
company you're probably very familiar
13:42
with controlling that largecale
13:44
equipment using the SCADA technology
13:47
this is a specialized system that allows
13:49
you to view manage control and maintain
13:53
these systems remotely and it does it
13:55
all across the network which obviously
13:58
means that we need a very secure network
14:00
so that no one else gains access to
14:02
these very valuable and in many cases
14:05
very important systems most
14:07
organizations with these SCADA systems
14:10
will have a completely segmented network
14:12
that is only accessible either by
14:14
physically visiting that particular part
14:16
of the network or accessing it through a
14:19
very controlled
14:21
system one of the interesting
14:23
characteristics of technology is once
14:25
you set it up and turn it on it will go
14:27
forever as long as it has power and the
14:30
system continues to be working properly
14:32
and it's not unusual to walk through a
14:34
data center and see equipment that was
14:36
installed 10 15 20 years ago or even
14:40
longer we usually refer to these older
14:42
systems as legacy systems just because
14:45
something is old doesn't mean that it's
14:47
not important and in many cases these
14:50
legacy systems can be very important
14:52
which is probably the reason that they
14:54
haven't been swapped out already and you
14:56
may find that learning how to manage and
14:59
maintain the legacy system can be just
15:02
as important as managing and maintaining
15:04
the brand new systems another important
15:07
service might be an embedded system an
15:09
embedded system is a purpose-built
15:11
device where very often we do not have
15:14
direct access to the operating system
15:16
that is running on that embedded system
15:19
for example if you think about a fire
15:20
alarm system or a time clock system
15:23
these are usually self-contained units
15:26
where you are interacting with those
15:28
devices on a daily basis but you don't
15:30
directly interact with the operating
15:32
system it's up to the manufacturer of
15:34
that equipment to provide you with the
15:36
tools to support it but very often it's
15:38
a system that doesn't require a lot of
15:40
ongoing maintenance the manufacturer of
15:43
the system will usually give you
15:44
everything you need to be able to keep
15:46
that system up and running but very
15:48
often you don't have to do a lot of
15:50
ongoing maintenance with an embedded
15:53
system another category of services that
15:55
has become very popular are IoT devices
15:58
or internet of things this is a broad
16:01
category of devices which could be
16:04
appliances such as refrigerators or
16:06
coffee makers it might be smart devices
16:09
where you can talk to the device and
16:11
have it perform a series of functions or
16:13
maybe this deals with air conditioning
16:15
or heating controls within your
16:17
organization some IoT devices can
16:19
provide access through a doorbell or a
16:22
garage door and one of the challenges
16:24
with IoT devices is that the companies
16:26
making refrigerators or speakers or
16:29
thermostats are very good at making
16:32
those appliances and air control systems
16:35
but they may not be good at connecting
16:37
to networks and maintaining security of
16:39
those networks for that reason you may
16:42
want to put these IoT devices on their
16:44
own segmented network to limit any
16:47
access that could occur should someone
16:49
gain access to an IoT device
