0:01
there will often be times where you're
0:03
handed a cable that has no connector on
0:05
it and you'll be asked to add the
0:07
appropriate connector to the end of that
0:09
cable This might be a coax cable it
0:12
could be twisted pair or it might be
0:14
fiber For copper connections we would
0:16
commonly use a tool like this one which
0:18
is a cable crimper This is a specialized
0:21
tool that allows us to pinch the end of
0:24
a connector permanently onto that
0:26
particular cable For example it's common
0:28
to use a crimper when you're connecting
0:30
the RJ45 connector onto a twisted pair
0:33
cable For twisted pair wires the
0:36
connector itself pushes through the
0:38
insulation around the wires to connect
0:40
directly to the copper that's inside For
0:43
example here is an RJ45 connector before
0:46
it has been crimped onto the cable You
0:48
can see that the copper connectors are
0:50
sticking up just a little bit And notice
0:52
they are very pointy at the ends That's
0:55
that pointy end that presses through the
0:58
insulation and makes its connection with
1:00
the copper inside Here's what that same
1:02
connector looks like after crimping You
1:04
can see it's been pushed into the
1:06
connector and it is going into the wire
1:09
that is now connected inside of that
1:11
RJ45 connector Notice that it also
1:14
pushes in a cable stay farther down the
1:16
cable so that it won't easily be pulled
1:18
out of that RJ45 connector If you're
1:21
planning to crimp your own RJ45 cables
1:24
you'll obviously need a very good
1:26
crimper You'll need a set of electrician
1:28
scissors or cable snips and you may need
1:30
a good wire stripper to remove any of
1:32
that excess cover from the outside of
1:34
the cable At first when you try to do
1:36
this yourself it may take quite a bit of
1:39
time as you're trying to determine the
1:41
best process to use to get all of the
1:43
wires in the right order and get them
1:45
properly pushed into the connector But
1:47
once you do this a few times you'll find
1:49
the process is relatively
1:50
straightforward And that means that you
1:52
could create your own custom length
1:54
cables with your own crimper and your
1:57
own RJ45
1:59
connectors Instead of dealing with wires
2:02
why don't we connect to the network over
2:03
a wireless connection Obviously wireless
2:06
does have the advantage of not dealing
2:08
with any wires but there are also a
2:10
number of issues and challenges with
2:12
managing a wireless network as well One
2:15
of the ways that you can analyze the
2:16
health of your wireless network is with
2:18
a Wi-Fi analyzer This can provide you
2:21
with information on the frequencies or
2:23
channels that are currently in use on
2:25
your network and the networks around you
2:27
You can see the signal strength that
2:29
you're getting from your local access
2:30
point You can see any interference that
2:33
may be occurring across this network And
2:35
you can see all of the wireless devices
2:37
that are communicating to your access
2:38
point If you want to get more detail
2:41
about what specifically might be using
2:43
the frequencies around you you might
2:45
want to use something like this a
2:47
spectrum analyzer This is able to look
2:49
at the entire spectrum and show you not
2:51
only the 802.11 network that's in use
2:54
but any other frequencies in use by
2:56
other devices in the area Here's an
2:59
example of the output on a simple Wi-Fi
3:01
analyzer that's looking at my wireless
3:04
network If you're far away from the
3:06
access point you may find that the noise
3:08
on this network is very comparable to
3:10
the amount of data This means that we
3:12
probably are not going to have the best
3:14
throughput on this wireless network As
3:16
we get closer to the access point you'll
3:19
find that the signal strength gets much
3:21
stronger and you're able to visually see
3:23
that difference in the Wi-Fi analyzer
3:26
One challenge we have on very large
3:29
networks is being able to find the two
3:31
ends of a cable especially if you're
3:33
dealing with hundreds and hundreds of
3:35
wires on the floor of a building One of
3:37
the ways that you can track down the
3:39
ends of these wires is by using a tone
3:42
generator This is really two different
3:45
devices One is the tone generator itself
3:47
that you plug into the wire and it puts
3:49
an analog sound onto the wire itself We
3:53
obviously can't hear that sound with our
3:55
own ears So we need some type of
3:57
inductive probe to be able to find that
4:00
sound even though we're not physically
4:02
touching the copper inside of the cable
4:05
This means if you have hundreds or
4:06
thousands of cables inside of a closet
4:09
you can use these tools to be able to
4:12
easily find the end of any one of those
4:14
wires We would first connect our tone
4:17
generator to the wire itself This can be
4:19
through a modular RJ45 connection This
4:22
might be a coax connector or you might
4:24
be plugging directly into the punchdown
4:26
block You would then use your inductive
4:28
probe to move from wire to wire until
4:30
you find the wire that makes some noise
4:33
Let's try finding the wire in my studio
4:36
and see if we can find the one that's
4:38
connected to our tone generator Here's a
4:41
tone generator I use on my studio
4:43
network Let's power it on And when this
4:46
is powered on we can then plug it into
4:48
one of the cables that I have inside of
4:50
my studio This is one of many that are
4:53
connected to my desk But now a signal is
4:56
being put onto this wire that we're able
4:58
to listen to using our inductive probe
5:01
So here's four wires that I have coming
5:03
into my studio but only one of these is
5:06
connected to our tone generator In order
5:08
to hear this we need an inductive probe
5:11
We don't have to touch the copper inside
5:13
of the cable We only have to put the
5:14
inductive probe somewhere along the
5:16
outside of the cable And when we run
5:18
across the cable that has the tone
5:20
generator we'll start to hear the noise
5:23
We'll see the lights flashing And we
5:24
know that we found the end of the cable
5:27
connected to that tone
5:28
generator If you are running a lot of
5:31
cables in your environment you're
5:32
probably terminating some of them onto a
5:35
punchdown block This is a punchdown
5:37
block very similar to what you might
5:38
find on the back wall of a data center
5:41
We might be bringing in hundreds or
5:43
thousands of cables and terminating them
5:45
on these punchdown blocks to make the
5:47
process of cross-connecting those cables
5:49
much easier This will individually
5:52
connect all of these wires into the
5:54
punchdown block and fasten them so they
5:56
won't be easily pulled out These tools
5:59
also trim the wire once you punch them
6:01
into the block making for a very clean
6:04
installation Here's an example of a
6:06
number of wires that are punched down
6:08
into a punchdown block You can see this
6:10
is a twisted pair wire And you can see
6:13
there are a lot of wires that you would
6:15
have punched into one of these blocks
6:17
That's why we tend to have these blocks
6:19
numbered so that we're able to reference
6:21
where this wire is and where the other
6:23
end of this wire happens to go You can
6:25
also tell that the person who punched
6:27
these down did a very good job of
6:29
maintaining these twists all the way
6:31
into the punchdown block Obviously it's
6:34
these twists that help us prevent any
6:36
type of interference So maintaining
6:38
those twists all the way into the
6:39
punchdown block makes for a stronger
6:42
network signal And of course it's often
6:44
good to document where this cable is
6:46
going so that we know what number it's
6:48
punched down into and we know where the
6:50
other end of the cable is That way if we
6:52
need to complete this connection into a
6:54
switch or some other device we can
6:56
easily find the cable that we're looking
6:58
for
7:00
If you're working a lot with cables
7:01
you're punching down wires into a block
7:03
or you're attaching your own connectors
7:06
then you probably want to use a cable
7:08
tester to make sure everything has been
7:10
wired properly on that cable If this is
7:12
a patch cable we want pin one to connect
7:14
to pin one We want pin two to connect to
7:17
pin two pin three to pin three and so on
7:20
A cable tester is perfect for checking
7:22
that continuity between all the pins and
7:24
ensuring that we really did connect the
7:26
right pins on both sides of the cable
7:29
This can also help us find any pins we
7:31
might have missed or if we happen to
7:33
accidentally cross a cable we'll see
7:35
that in our cable tester Cable testers
7:38
are usually simple continuity tests
7:40
They're not providing any type of
7:42
quality signal testing but they do
7:44
provide us with a quick way to know if
7:46
we're wiring things the proper way The
7:49
tone generator and inductive probe I
7:51
used earlier also double as a cable
7:53
tester I have the tone generator set
7:56
into cable testing mode and it's
7:58
flashing to tell me that it doesn't see
8:00
any wires because I don't have anything
8:02
currently connected to that device I'm
8:05
going to plug in a cable into one end of
8:07
this cable tester and we'll plug in the
8:09
other end of this cable into the other
8:12
end of this cable tester What we're
8:14
hoping to see is a continuity test from
8:16
pins 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 And you can see
8:22
it cycle through each one of those wires
8:24
If these wires were not connected then
8:26
we would not see a light for that
8:28
particular pin And if it was connected
8:30
to a different pin we would see the
8:32
lights jump around as it went through
8:33
its test It's a relatively simple test
8:36
but it can tell us very quickly if we
8:38
were able to put the wires in the right
8:39
order when we put on the connector
8:42
One challenge you often run into is that
8:45
some equipment may show that there's a
8:47
number of errors on a particular link
8:49
but you don't know if the errors are
8:51
being caused by a bad cable or if the
8:53
problem is within the hardware itself
8:56
This is where we would use a loop back
8:58
plug Loop back plugs are very useful for
9:00
testing the physical interface on a
9:02
device There are different loop back
9:04
plugs for serial connections RJ45
9:07
connections or even fiber connections
9:10
These are not crossover cables They are
9:12
a cable that effectively loops back into
9:15
itself To use these we would plug one
9:18
into the interface on a device and then
9:20
we would put that interface into a
9:22
diagnostic mode That diagnostic mode
9:24
sends information out of the interface
9:26
and then it looks to see if any of that
9:28
information is being looped back into
9:30
the receive part of that interface If
9:33
everything is working properly then the
9:35
information we receive should match the
9:37
information that we're sending If we see
9:39
any difference between the information
9:42
sent and the information received then
9:44
it's very possible that we have a
9:46
problem with that physical
9:47
interface And eventually you may be
9:50
tasked with gathering packets directly
9:52
from the network And there are a number
9:54
of different ways to gather those
9:56
details One way is to use a physical tap
9:59
We break a connection and put this
10:01
physical tap in the middle of the
10:03
network link Obviously this is not
10:05
something you can commonly do during
10:07
production hours on a production network
10:09
but if you know that that particular
10:11
connection will be used often for packet
10:13
gathering purposes you may want to
10:15
install a tap there permanently Many
10:18
fiber taps tend to be passive taps which
10:20
means they don't require any power Other
10:23
taps may require a power source
10:24
especially if you're dealing with a
10:26
copper tap If you're not able to disrupt
10:29
the network communication by installing
10:31
a tap you might want to use
10:33
functionality that may be built into
10:35
your enterprise switch This is referring
10:37
to a port mirror Sometimes you'll hear
10:39
this referred to as a port redirection
10:42
or a span It stands for a switched port
10:44
analyzer With this port mirror function
10:47
you would plug in your network analyzer
10:49
to one interface and you would tell the
10:51
switch to take everything from another
10:53
interface and copy those frames into
10:56
this protocol analyzer port This allows
10:58
you to get a copy of all of the network
11:00
traffic without having to put a physical
11:02
tap in the middle You're effectively
11:04
using the capabilities of your switch as
11:07
your physical tap Here's a copper coax
11:10
tap You can see on one side is the
11:12
network connection on the other side is
11:14
the equipment connection Normally these
11:16
would connect from receive to transmit
11:18
and transmit to receive But with the tap
11:20
in the middle we would take one of those
11:22
connections and put it through the tap
11:24
Then we take the other direction and
11:26
also put it through the tap Now that
11:28
we've tapped that data we can connect a
11:30
monitor or protocol analyzer and be able
11:33
to get a copy of everything sent over
11:35
those particular links
