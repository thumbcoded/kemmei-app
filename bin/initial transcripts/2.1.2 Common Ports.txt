0:02
as we've discussed in a previous video
0:04
the port numbers used by TCP and UDP can
0:07
be very important when trying to
0:09
communicate to a service so it's useful
0:11
to know what those port numbers are if
0:13
you're trying to troubleshoot any type
0:15
of communications issue we might also
0:18
need to know these port numbers if we're
0:19
performing some type of firewall
0:21
configuration our firewalls often use
0:24
TCP and UDP port numbers as one of the
0:27
criteria that it uses to allow or to
0:29
block Lo Network traffic as you go
0:31
through this video you'll find there are
0:33
a number of port numbers that you're
0:35
required to know as part of your A+
0:37
studies you'll find that memorizing
0:39
these port numbers can sometimes feel a
0:41
bit tedious but after you start using
0:44
these applications configuring firewalls
0:46
and troubleshooting network
0:47
communication you'll find that most of
0:49
these port numbers become second nature
0:52
for the purposes of your A+ studies make
0:54
sure that you understand not only the
0:56
port number and the protocol associated
0:59
with it but that you understand why that
1:01
particular protocol is important and how
1:03
it's used on the
1:05
network the first port numbers we'll
1:07
look at are port numbers TCP Port 20 and
1:10
TCP Port 21 these two port numbers are
1:13
commonly associated with FTP or the file
1:16
transfer protocol FTP is a generic file
1:19
transfer protocol that could be used by
1:21
many different operating systems to
1:22
transfer information from one device to
1:25
another and different types of FTP may
1:27
use one or both of these prot protocols
1:30
TCP Port 20 is often used as the active
1:33
data transfer and Port 21 is often used
1:37
as the administration or control Port
1:40
the FTP protocol often requires you to
1:42
have some type of authentication into
1:44
this system so it may ask for a username
1:46
a password or some other type of
1:49
authentication Factor FTP can also be
1:51
configured with an anonymous or generic
1:54
login so that anyone can log in
1:56
regardless of what the username or
1:58
password might be FTP is also a
2:01
full-featured protocol that not only can
2:03
transfer a file but can list the files
2:05
available in a particular directory we
2:07
can add delete change the file name and
2:10
perform other Administration functions
2:12
as
2:13
well as part of our tasks as server
2:15
administrators or network administrators
2:18
we are often required to connect to our
2:20
Remote device and make configuration
2:22
changes at the command line to be able
2:25
to do this securely across the network
2:27
we need to use a protocol that can
2:29
encrypt all of this data as we're
2:30
sending it from one side to the other
2:33
the most common protocol used for this
2:35
function is SSH or secure shell it
2:38
provides an encrypted communication link
2:40
over TCP Port 22 this is very similar to
2:44
the old style tnet protocol but tnet is
2:47
one that we commonly no longer see in
2:50
use because it does not provide any type
2:52
of encryption if you're communicating at
2:54
the command line to a server you should
2:56
always be using SSH and you'll find that
2:59
it almost always is using TCP Port
3:02
22 however you may find that there is a
3:05
system in your network that is very old
3:08
that does not support SSH and the only
3:11
way to administer that device at the
3:13
command line is using the older tnet
3:16
protocol telnet stands for
3:17
telecommunications Network and it
3:19
commonly communicates over TCP Port 23
3:23
visually and functionally this works
3:25
identical to SSH you have a command line
3:28
you can log into a device with your
3:30
username and password you can administer
3:32
that device remotely but the major
3:35
difference is that all of the
3:36
communication used for tnet is in the
3:38
clear there's no encryption used for
3:41
tnet and that's why most organizations
3:43
will prevent anyone from using the tnet
3:46
protocol and instead recommend that you
3:48
use SSH to perform this
3:51
communication email continues to be one
3:54
of the most popular forms of
3:55
communication across our networks and to
3:58
be able to facilitate that communication
4:00
we need some type of protocol that can
4:02
send mail from one server to another
4:05
that protocol is the simple mail
4:06
transfer protocol or SMTP SMTP commonly
4:10
uses TCP Port 25 to be able to send
4:14
these email messages from one email
4:16
server to another you may also find that
4:19
some devices are configured to send
4:20
information to the email server
4:22
initially also using this SMTP protocol
4:26
so not only are you configuring this on
4:28
your mail server you may also o find
4:30
that you're configuring SMTP with the
4:32
appropriate port number on your local
4:34
device to be able to receive email
4:36
messages we would commonly use protocols
4:39
such as IMAP or pop 3 and we'll talk
4:42
about those protocols and their
4:43
Associated port numbers later in this
4:46
video in these videos so far we've
4:48
talked a lot about devices able to
4:50
communicate with each other using IP or
4:53
Internet Protocol the Internet Protocol
4:56
address is one very similar to what you
4:58
would see here one 62.1 159 2461 164 but
5:04
when we're typing things into our
5:05
browser we're not typing in a bunch of
5:07
numbers we're typing in the name of a
5:09
website such as
5:11
www.professormesser.com
5:13
in order to translate this fully
5:15
qualified domain name into a usable IP
5:18
address for network communication we
5:20
need to perform a translation using the
5:23
domain name system or DNS DNS commonly
5:27
uses UDP Port 53
5:30
as you can imagine DNS is a very popular
5:32
and important service because we almost
5:35
never memorize IP addresses to be able
5:37
to communicate to these devices but it's
5:39
very common to remember the fully
5:41
qualified domain name for that reason
5:43
it's very common to have multiple DNS
5:45
servers for redundancy so that we are
5:48
always able to resolve the fully
5:49
qualified domain name to the appropriate
5:52
IP
5:53
address the computer on your network was
5:56
probably not manually configured with a
5:58
set of IP addresses subnet masks default
6:01
gateways or DNS servers this was done
6:04
automatically when you turn your
6:06
computer on using the dynamic host
6:08
configuration protocol or
6:10
DHCP DHCP happens automatically behind
6:13
the scenes and it makes the entire
6:15
process of configuring your system with
6:17
these addresses completely seamless DHCP
6:20
commonly uses UDP Port 67 and UDP Port
6:24
68 on your network is a DHCP service
6:28
that may be on a standalone server or
6:30
Appliance or may be integrated into a
6:32
small office home office wireless router
6:35
that you might have at home on this
6:36
server is a pool of available IP
6:39
addresses and when a device connects to
6:41
the network it requests an IP address
6:43
and configuration parameters from that
6:45
pool when a device starts up it receives
6:47
that IP address and it leases that IP
6:49
address for a certain amount of time
6:51
when that lease is up it can choose to
6:53
renew the lease or give the IP address
6:55
back and put it into the pool for
6:57
someone else to use system
6:59
administrators can also use DHCP to
7:02
manually configure IP addresses that
7:04
will always be assigned to particular
7:06
devices so if you have a printer or
7:08
server that you would like to always
7:10
have the same IP address you can reserve
7:12
that IP address in your DHCP server and
7:15
it will be automatically assigned with
7:17
the same IP address every time that
7:19
printer or server starts
7:21
up you're probably watching this video
7:24
in a browser and to be able to perform
7:26
that functionality you're probably using
7:29
HTT TP or https this is the hypertext
7:32
transfer protocol or hypertext transfer
7:35
protocol secure the standard form of
7:38
HTTP sends all of the HTTP data over a
7:41
non-encrypted or in the clear
7:43
communication and it often uses TCP Port
7:46
80 if you see any traffic using TCP Port
7:49
443 it's probably using the secure
7:52
version of HTTP which means that all of
7:55
that web communication inside of that
7:57
packet will be encrypted a large
7:59
percentage of the devices you
8:01
communicate to in your browser are
8:02
probably going to use https these days
8:05
but you'll still find a number of web
8:07
services that are not using the
8:09
encrypted version and instead are
8:11
sending all of their traffic via TCP
8:13
Port 80 and the HTTP
8:16
protocol if you're using an email client
8:18
on your computer or your mobile device
8:21
you may be receiving emails using a
8:23
number of different protocols two of the
8:25
more popular Protocols are POP 3 and
8:28
IMAP POP 3 is the post office protocol
8:32
version three and it commonly uses TCP
8:34
Port 110 to be able to transfer data
8:37
down to your computer a newer and
8:39
somewhat more functional protocol for
8:41
receiving email is IMAP 4 or the
8:44
internet message access protocol version
8:46
4 IMAP commonly uses TCP Port 143 IMAP
8:51
provides a number of additional features
8:53
not available in pop 3 such as the
8:55
management of the inbox from multiple
8:57
clients you're able to make make folders
9:00
and transfer emails into those folders
9:02
and all of those updates will be
9:03
synchronized across all of your
9:05
different systems and all of those
9:07
updates will be synchronized across all
9:09
of your different email
9:11
clients if you're using Microsoft
9:13
Windows there's a process for
9:15
transferring data within windows that
9:18
uses a protocol named server message
9:20
block or SMB you may also see this
9:23
referred to as the common internet file
9:25
system or cifs not only is this used for
9:28
file trans transfers it's used to send
9:31
information to printer cues and for
9:33
other processes where Windows needs to
9:35
communicate information between
9:36
different Windows devices older Windows
9:39
devices used an additional protocol
9:41
inside of tcpip called netbios this net
9:45
bios protocol used two primary port
9:48
numbers to be able to communicate UDP
9:50
Port 137 used a net bios name service
9:54
which is very similar to the DNS name
9:56
service that we talked about earlier and
9:58
to be able to set up sessions to
10:00
transfer files it uses TCP Port 139 on
10:04
most modern versions of Windows you'll
10:07
find Direct connectivity between IP
10:09
addresses that don't use the net bios
10:11
protocol we refer to that as direct
10:14
communication or net bios less
10:16
communication and it often uses TCP Port
10:21
445 most organizations will have a
10:23
central database that contains all of
10:25
the important information about the
10:27
devices users and and important
10:29
resources available on their Network
10:32
this is usually a directory of services
10:34
or a database that contains all of this
10:36
information and to be able to access
10:39
this database we use a standard set of
10:41
protocols one of these protocols is ldap
10:44
or ldaps this stands for the lightweight
10:47
directory access protocol or the
10:49
lightweight directory access protocol
10:51
secure ldap commonly uses TCP port 389
10:55
this directory is usually separated into
10:58
different categories such as an
11:00
organization an organizational unit or a
11:03
common name for example at mess Studios
11:06
we might have a production
11:07
organizational unit a support
11:09
organizational unit and an engineering
11:12
organizational unit and of course within
11:14
those there may be individuals using a
11:17
common name such as Sam or Daniel and we
11:20
might also have a database called Tech
11:22
docs using ldap we can refer to this
11:24
database to find where these components
11:26
might be and in some cases even provide
11:28
a additional details such as
11:30
authentication for any individual users
11:33
a very common use of ldap is Microsoft's
11:36
active directory infrastructure where
11:39
that database is able to be referenced
11:41
using the ldap
11:43
protocol if you are troubleshooting
11:45
technology then you're probably very
11:47
familiar with remote control access of a
11:50
separate machine these days we have
11:52
users around the world and it's not very
11:54
practical for you to visit every single
11:56
one of those users directly to be able
11:58
to solve problems s on their computer in
12:00
those cases we'll probably use some type
12:02
of remote access protocol such as RDP or
12:06
remote desktop protocol this allows you
12:08
to view and share the desktop on a
12:11
Remote device using TCP Port
12:14
3389 this is primarily used to access
12:17
Windows devices and to be able to
12:19
control those windows devices across the
12:21
network you can usually do this from a
12:23
Windows device itself or from many other
12:25
operating systems as well you can use
12:28
RDP to control an entire computer or to
12:30
Simply run a single application on that
12:33
remote computer and although RDP is
12:35
commonly associated with connecting to
12:37
Windows devices there are also many RDP
12:40
clients that would allow you to connect
12:42
to that Windows computer from Mac OS
12:45
Linux Unix iPhone and other operating
12:48
systems as well
