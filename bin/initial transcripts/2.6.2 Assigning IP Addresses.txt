if you're responsible for configuring IP
0:04
addresses on a device you know there are
0:06
a number of important parameters that
0:09
you'll need to add one of these of
0:11
course is the IP address itself every
0:13
device needs a different IP address and
0:16
you may need to assign these manually or
0:18
configure this IP address into the
0:21
configuration of the service so you may
0:23
add for example
0:27
192.168.1.165 and now you've configured
0:29
the IP address but of course you don't
0:32
have an IP address unless you also have
0:34
a subnet mask the subnet mask is used by
0:37
that local device to determine which
0:40
subnet it actually sits on when we refer
0:42
to an IP subnet we're referring to this
0:45
combination of an IP address and a
0:47
subnet mask a typical subnet mask might
0:50
be 255.255
0:53
255.255.0 and since the subnet mask is
0:56
not something that's commonly sent
0:58
across the network we'll need to get
1:00
with the network administrator for that
1:01
IP subnet to confirm that we have the
1:04
correct subnet mask and if this device
1:06
needs to communicate outside of this
1:08
local subnet they'll need the IP address
1:11
of the local router this is often
1:13
referred to as a default gateway for
1:16
example the default gateway on this
1:17
network might be
1:20
192.168.1.1 you'll commonly be provided
1:22
with all three of these by the network
1:24
administrator and this is what will give
1:26
you the basic connectivity to
1:28
communicate on your local subnet and
1:30
outside of this local subnet there may
1:33
be other parameters that you need to
1:35
manually configure such as DNS server
1:37
configurations NTP servers voiceover IP
1:41
servers and other important IP
1:43
configuration parameters
1:45
in an earlier video we talked about DHCP
1:48
or the dynamic host configuration
1:50
protocol and how it's used to
1:52
automatically assign IP addresses on
1:54
your devices but there may be times when
1:56
we don't want to have our IP address
1:58
pulled randomly from a DHCP pool instead
2:01
we would like the IP address for a
2:03
device to always be that IP address we
2:06
refer to this IP address that doesn't
2:08
change as a static IP address one common
2:12
way to assign a static IP address is to
2:14
type it in manually on that device you
2:17
can usually find this in the
2:18
configuration settings of this device
2:20
where you can input the IP address the
2:22
subnet mask the gateway a preferred DNS
2:25
and other important IP address
2:27
configuration options this is one where
2:30
we have to make sure that what we're
2:31
typing in is exactly correct because
2:33
this is not something that's provided
2:35
automatically if we make a mistake
2:37
typing this in then this device won't be
2:39
able to communicate properly on the
2:41
network but manually configuring IP
2:44
addresses on all of your network devices
2:46
can be timeconuming and difficult to
2:49
manage what if you'd like to change the
2:51
IP address of your default gateway or
2:53
what if the IP addresses of your DNS
2:55
servers happens to change you would have
2:57
to manually go back to all of those
2:59
devices and type in the new parameters
3:02
that process may be something easy to
3:04
manage if you have a handful of devices
3:06
at home but in a company where you have
3:08
hundreds or even thousands of devices
3:11
manually configuring static IP addresses
3:13
is not very scalable generally speaking
3:16
manually configuring IP addresses is not
3:19
the best practice but there are ways to
3:22
manually set static IP addresses on a
3:25
device on the DHCP server itself that's
3:28
a central point where you can manage all
3:30
of these IP addresses and it's a
3:32
configuration setting inside the DHCP
3:35
server called a DHCP reservation this is
3:38
a process that links the MAC address of
3:41
this device to a specific IP address so
3:44
instead of configuring these manually
3:46
you would change that configuration
3:48
setting to DHCP this device will then
3:51
access the DHCP server find that there
3:54
is a DHCP reservation and always use the
3:56
same static address because it has been
3:59
administratively assigned on the DHCP
4:02
server itself now if you change the IP
4:05
address of your default gateway or the
4:07
IP addresses of your DNS servers change
4:09
you configure that on your DHCP server
4:12
and the next time the system starts up
4:14
it will receive the new set of IP
4:16
parameters without you having to
4:18
manually visit that
4:20
device most of us rely on DHCP to
4:23
provide that automatic IP addressing
4:26
mechanism if you're working on a
4:27
computer at home at work at a hotel or a
4:30
coffee shop you've probably been
4:32
assigned an IP address automatically
4:34
using their local DHCP server but what
4:38
if you're on a network that doesn't have
4:40
a DHCP server and your system is
4:42
configured to look for that DHCP
4:45
configuration in those situations your
4:47
device is not going to receive a DHCP
4:49
address and so it's up to the device to
4:52
determine what to do next in most cases
4:55
the operating system is going to assign
4:57
an
4:58
API address this stands for an automatic
5:01
private IP addressing scheme we also
5:04
refer to this as an IP version 4 link
5:07
local address this is an IP address that
5:09
allows you to communicate with other
5:11
devices on your local IP address subnet
5:14
but it's not able to route outside of
5:16
your local subnet this means you might
5:19
not have internet connectivity because
5:21
you're not able to route outside of your
5:23
local subnet with an APIPA address but
5:26
you are able to communicate with other
5:27
devices on your local subnet so that you
5:30
can do some basic network
5:31
troubleshooting and determine why you're
5:33
not able to communicate with the DHCP
5:36
server the APIPA standard sets a block
5:39
of addresses that could possibly be used
5:42
for this link local address this is a
5:45
very large range it ranges between
5:48
169.254.0.0 through
5:53
169.254.255.255 this standard also
5:55
reserves the first 256 addresses and the
5:59
last 256 addresses which means the IP
6:02
address that you'll receive on your
6:04
device via APIPA will be
6:08
169.254.1.0 through
6:13
169.254.254.255 if you look at the IP
6:15
address on your device and you notice
6:17
that it's in this range then you know
6:19
your device has assigned itself an APIPA
6:23
address this also means that your DHCP
6:26
server is probably not communicating and
6:28
you'll need to troubleshoot that before
6:30
you're able to receive DHCP assigned
6:33
addresses again when your computer
6:35
realizes that DHCP servers are not
6:38
responding and it automatically assigns
6:40
itself an API address it has to make
6:43
sure that nobody else is using the
6:45
random IP address that it chose in that
6:47
very large block to be able to make this
6:50
determination your device sends an ARP
6:53
request out to the network asking if any
6:55
other device is currently using the IP
6:58
address that it would like to use for
7:00
example your device could randomly
7:02
choose 169.25
7:06
254.77.77 so it will send an ARP request
7:09
to your local subnet with a broadcast
7:11
that says "Does anybody else out there
7:14
have
7:17
169.254.77.77?" And if it does not
7:18
receive a response it assumes that that
7:20
address is available to use and it will
7:23
automatically assign that IP address to
7:25
your local machine
7:28
so if you're currently using DHCP and
7:30
you notice that occasionally the IP
7:32
address of your device will change to a
7:34
different IP then you may want to set
7:36
something that is more static if you're
7:39
on a corporate network then you're
7:40
probably using some type of static IP
7:43
addressing already your switches your
7:45
firewalls your routers and your printers
7:47
are probably configured with a static IP
7:50
address you could of course disable DHCP
7:53
on those devices and manually type in
7:55
all of your IP address configuration
7:57
settings but more commonly we'll use an
8:00
IP reservation on the DHCP server so
8:03
that every time you start your router
8:05
your switch your printer or any of these
8:07
other devices they will automatically
8:09
receive the same IP address from the
8:11
DHCP server because you've configured an
8:14
IP reservation
