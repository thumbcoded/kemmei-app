when we hear the term wireless
0:03
technologies most of us probably think
0:06
about the wireless networks that we use
0:08
at home or at our business to be able to
0:10
connect to other devices on the network
0:12
or to the internet This type of network
0:15
is one that is standardized by the ILE E
0:18
This is the Institute of Electrical and
0:20
Electronics Engineers And the committee
0:22
that handles the standards for this type
0:25
of network is the 802.11 committee
0:28
That's why you'll often hear these
0:30
networks referred to as 802.11 networks
0:33
However the 802.11 committee realizes
0:36
that using the 802.11 name along with a
0:39
series of letters to designate what
0:41
version of the network it happens to be
0:43
might be confusing for some So in order
0:46
to make this a bit easier to follow
0:48
they've changed the naming convention so
0:50
that the 802.11 AC standard is also
0:53
called WFI 5 They then referred to the
0:57
802.11 AX standard as Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi
1:01
6E for extended And the
1:04
802.11BE standard is also called Wi-Fi 7
1:08
This makes it a bit easier to
1:10
differentiate between versions So
1:12
instead of using those 802.11 names you
1:15
can simply use Wi-Fi 5 Wi-Fi 6 Wi-Fi 7
1:19
and so on Our Wi-Fi networks have a
1:22
number of different frequencies that
1:23
they might use to be able to facilitate
1:25
this communication And different
1:27
standards of Wi-Fi use different
1:30
frequencies Most Wi-Fi networks will use
1:32
frequencies in the 2.4 GHz range the 5
1:35
GHz range and the 6 GHz range And some
1:39
access points and devices can
1:41
communicate across multiple ranges
1:43
simultaneously Instead of having to
1:45
memorize or reference a specific
1:47
frequency the 802.11 committee has
1:50
grouped frequencies together into
1:52
channels These channels are much easier
1:54
to remember than the exact frequency
1:57
value and allows you to quickly refer to
1:59
where a frequency might be based on a
2:02
broader channel number You can see these
2:04
channels being used if you look at the
2:06
wireless configuration for your device
2:08
On my device I'm running in the 2.4 GHz
2:11
range on channel 6 If you go back to the
2:14
ITLE E standards you can see that that
2:16
is also the
2:18
2.437 GHz frequency that's being used
2:22
for channel 6 I'm also using the 5 GHz
2:25
range And you can see I'm using channel
2:27
44 If we look that up we can see that
2:30
I'm communicating on
2:31
5.220 GHz You can see that it's much
2:34
easier to refer back to channel 44
2:37
rather than specifying the
2:40
5.220 GHz frequency We refer to the
2:43
amount of spectrum that we would use as
2:45
the bandwidth for that communication And
2:48
it's very common to see bandwidths of 20
2:50
40 80 or 160 MHz Let's compare the
2:55
different bandwidths and frequencies
2:57
that might be in use on an 802.11
3:00
network Let's start with the 2.4 GHz
3:02
spectrum Relatively speaking 2.4 GHz
3:06
doesn't provide you with many
3:07
frequencies And if you're using that in
3:09
a confined area with a lot of wireless
3:11
networks you may find that there's a lot
3:13
of interference from other devices This
3:16
is showing three different 20 meghertz
3:18
ranges that do not overlap in the 2.4
3:21
GHz spectrum which means there's really
3:23
three channels to choose from if you're
3:26
running something in 2.4 GHz You can see
3:29
now why we expanded into the 5 GHz range
3:32
where you have many more frequencies
3:35
available Not only in 20 MHz bandwidths
3:38
but if you wanted to use even more
3:40
bandwidth on that network to increase
3:42
your throughput you could have 40 MHz 80
3:45
MHz or 160 MHz in the 5 GHz spectrum And
3:50
when you look at 6 GHz you can see that
3:52
you have much more spectrum to work with
3:54
many more frequencies available that
3:56
allow you a lot of different bandwidths
3:58
across the 6 GHz
4:01
range But 802.11 is not the only way to
4:04
transmit wirelessly If you're using a
4:07
wireless headset or wireless speakers
4:09
you're probably using Bluetooth to be
4:11
able to connect those devices to your
4:13
computer Bluetooth technology uses the
4:15
2.4 GHz range You might also see this
4:18
referred to as the unlicensed ISM
4:21
frequencies That stands for the
4:23
industrial scientific and medical band
4:26
These are frequencies that don't require
4:27
any specialized licenses to be able to
4:30
use them which is why we can simply turn
4:32
on our computers and be able to connect
4:34
to other devices using 802.11 or
4:36
Bluetooth With 802.11 we can move around
4:39
a building and still have access to the
4:41
network But Bluetooth ranges are a bit
4:44
more confined This is why we often will
4:46
see these being used with devices that
4:48
are personally connected to us If you're
4:50
using consumer devices with Bluetooth
4:53
they have a maximum range of about 10
4:56
m Another popular wireless technology is
4:59
RFID or radio frequency identification
5:02
RFID has many different uses You might
5:05
find it in the badges you use to gain
5:07
access to your building There might be
5:09
RFID tags inside products you might
5:11
purchase or across an assembly line You
5:14
might also find RFID technology inside
5:16
of our pets This allows you to scan the
5:18
pet and know immediately who that pet
5:21
belongs to This is an example of an RFID
5:24
tag that's about the size of this grain
5:26
of rice that's right next to it There
5:28
are also other styles of tags This one
5:30
is flat Commonly see this inside of
5:33
access cards This design around the
5:35
outside is the antenna And if you look
5:37
closely at the middle you'll see the
5:39
actual RFID chip You'll notice there's
5:41
no battery connected to this RFID tag It
5:44
usually sits idle with no power
5:46
whatsoever But when you bring a scanner
5:48
close to this device the power from that
5:51
radio frequency is enough to power the
5:53
RFID tag The scanner then receives an ID
5:57
code from the tag and then compares that
5:59
to the information it has in a database
6:01
to determine what that ID tag is
6:04
referencing There are also other types
6:06
of RFID tags you might run into that do
6:08
have batteries that are able to be
6:10
actively powered so that you're able to
6:13
scan that device from a longer distance
6:15
away And many of our mobile devices
6:18
these days have another style of
6:20
wireless technology known as NFC or near
6:24
field communication NFC builds on the
6:27
technology of RFID which is generally a
6:30
one-way communication and extends that
6:32
to have two-way communication to your
6:34
NFC devices One popular use of NFC is to
6:38
use your phone or your smartwatch to pay
6:40
for products at a point of sale terminal
6:42
And if you've ever set up a device that
6:44
needs to connect to a Bluetooth network
6:46
or a wireless network it often uses NFC
6:49
in conjunction with your mobile phone to
6:52
be able to give it the configuration
6:54
parameters it needs to connect to your
6:56
network And since many people are
6:57
carrying around their phones with NFC
6:59
functionality you could use that to open
7:02
a door or to provide a type of
7:04
identification
