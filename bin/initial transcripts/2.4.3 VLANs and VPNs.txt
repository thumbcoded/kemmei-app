let's start our conversation referring
0:04
to LANs or local area networks this is a
0:08
group of devices that are connected
0:10
together into a single broadcast domain
0:14
that means if we send a broadcast out on
0:16
one of these devices to this LAN all of
0:20
the other devices in this LAN will also
0:23
see the broadcast over on this side we
0:25
have a separate switch and because it is
0:27
a separate switch it is a separate
0:30
broadcast domain which means any device
0:32
on this network that sends a broadcast
0:34
would only be seen by other devices
0:37
connected to that same broadcast domain
0:39
that means if we send a broadcast over
0:41
on the red network no devices on the
0:44
blue network will be able to see that
0:46
broadcast because this is a single
0:48
broadcast domain that is separate from
0:51
all of the other broadcast domains from
0:54
a security and an organizational
0:56
perspective this is a very good design
0:58
everyone on the red network is connected
1:00
to the red network switch and everybody
1:03
on the blue network is connected to the
1:04
blue network switch but one of the
1:06
challenges with this is that it doesn't
1:08
make very efficient use of our switches
1:11
for example we have a switch here with
1:12
24 interfaces and only two devices are
1:15
connected to that device we have a
1:18
separate 24- port switch on this side
1:20
and that switch also only has two
1:22
devices on it if we wanted to save money
1:25
and save space in our rack we would put
1:27
all of these devices on the same
1:29
physical switch but when we do that we
1:32
have a problem with all of these devices
1:34
being on the same broadcast domain
1:37
fortunately many of our modern switches
1:40
have the ability to configure a virtual
1:43
local area network or a VLAN a virtual
1:46
local area network means that we can
1:48
assign different interfaces on a switch
1:51
to belong to a particular VLAN this is a
1:54
very good example of combining two
1:56
separate switches into one single switch
1:59
but then assigning different interfaces
2:01
to different VLANs that means we can
2:03
have some interfaces on the switch on
2:05
the red VLAN and other interfaces on the
2:08
switch on the blue VLAN and because
2:11
these VLANs are also separate broadcast
2:14
domains if we send a broadcast from any
2:16
of these devices on the blue network
2:18
that broadcast is only seen by other
2:21
devices on these blue network interfaces
2:24
the same thing applies for the red
2:25
network if we send a broadcast on a red
2:28
network device only devices that are
2:30
part of that VLAN will be able to see
2:32
that broadcast now we have a single
2:35
switch with a single power source taking
2:37
up the space of a single switch in one
2:40
rack and we're able to support multiple
2:43
VLANs on that same physical device this
2:46
is obviously a much more efficient way
2:48
to combine these network interfaces
2:50
together and it's a way that we could
2:52
take what used to be two physical
2:54
devices and now have them running on one
2:57
single device with logical separation
3:00
between these different interfaces
3:03
we can support many VLANs on a single
3:06
switch this particular switch has been
3:07
configured with three separate VLANs and
3:10
we can have some devices connected to
3:12
VLAN one which is the gate room we have
3:15
other devices that are connected to VLAN
3:17
2 that's the dialing room and then VLAN
3:20
3 is the infirmary the devices on one
3:23
VLAN are not able to communicate to
3:25
devices on the other VLANs because they
3:28
have been put into a completely separate
3:30
broadcast domain from a networking
3:32
perspective there might be a good reason
3:34
to allow these different VLANs to
3:36
communicate to each other and in that
3:38
particular case we need a router to be
3:40
able to route information from one VLAN
3:42
to another some switches allow you to
3:44
configure routing functionality within
3:46
that switch itself or you may use an
3:49
external router just to provide
3:51
communication between these different
3:53
VLANs another important service that
3:55
you'll find on most people's networks is
3:57
a VPN or virtual private network this
4:01
allows devices to communicate to each
4:03
other across a network but it encrypts
4:05
all of the data that's being sent over
4:07
the network if someone was to capture
4:09
that data and view it in a packet
4:12
capture program or something similar
4:14
they wouldn't be able to understand
4:15
anything that was being sent back and
4:17
forth between those devices there's
4:19
usually a specialized device that is
4:21
able to encrypt and decrypt this
4:24
information in real time we refer to
4:26
that device as a concentrator this is
4:28
usually built into a firewall or some
4:30
other type of purpose-built appliance
4:32
this allows everyone to connect to a
4:34
central concentrator which is then
4:36
responsible for converting between the
4:38
encrypted data coming across the network
4:41
decrypting that so that we can view it
4:43
on the inside of our network and
4:45
reversing that process to send
4:46
information back to the originating
4:48
station this is commonly implemented as
4:51
hardware but there are VPN concentrator
4:53
solutions that are provided as software
4:56
only that we can run on an existing
4:58
server many operating systems have VPN
5:01
client software that's built into the
5:03
operating system itself but you might
5:05
also have third-party VPN software that
5:07
you would then install into an operating
5:10
system if you've ever worked from home
5:13
then you've probably used a client to
5:16
siteVPN the client would be you the
5:18
remote user at home and the site would
5:21
be a concentrator at a central point
5:23
usually at the edge of a much larger
5:26
corporate network all of the users and
5:28
devices that are outside the building
5:30
would connect to that central
5:32
concentrator across the internet and
5:34
that concentrator is obviously connected
5:36
to the internal corporate network this
5:39
means that all of the communication from
5:40
the remote user to the concentrator are
5:43
always encrypted so we know that all of
5:45
the data we're sending over the network
5:47
is completely protected the concentrator
5:50
is responsible for taking that encrypted
5:52
communication decrypting it and sending
5:54
it on its way to the resources that
5:56
we're accessing inside of our corporate
5:58
network this might also be configured as
6:01
an always on configuration so the moment
6:03
the remote user turns on and logs into
6:06
their laptop it automatically creates
6:08
that link to the concentrator this means
6:10
you don't have to worry about manually
6:12
starting your VPN software if you are on
6:15
your network and connected to the
6:16
internet then you always have an
6:18
encrypted channel all the way back to
6:20
your VPN concentrator for large
6:22
organizations you might have a corporate
6:24
network at a central location and then
6:26
you might have other remote sites at
6:28
other physical locations one of the ways
6:30
that you're able to connect those sites
6:32
together is through an existing internet
6:34
link of course we're always concerned
6:36
about security and somebody being able
6:38
to see the information we're sending
6:40
over the internet so it's very common
6:42
for organizations to connect these sites
6:44
together using a
6:46
sightto-sightVPN this is usually
6:47
implemented using firewalls so you'd
6:49
have a firewall connecting to the
6:51
corporate network the internet and then
6:53
a separate firewall that's connecting to
6:55
that remote site you would then
6:57
configure a sight to-sightVPN between
6:59
these two sites so that anytime you're
7:02
sending information from your remote
7:03
site back to the corporate network it
7:05
will always be going through an
7:07
encrypted channel the firewalls act as
7:09
your VPN concentrator so anything on the
7:11
inside of your network is in the clear
7:14
but anytime you have to send information
7:15
across the internet to a remote site it
7:18
will always be encrypted using the sight
7:20
to-sightVPN
