Conceptual topics:
1. Should we refactor Kemmei into something like NodeJS?
2. Should we make it an executable/standalone app vs web app?
2.2 Or - a locally run web app?
2.3 If executable - should we run data/user base as a web service?
3. For start, admin probably should be decoupled from the app?
3.1 If not, should we enable admin for every user?
3.2 Isn't our system overcomplicated for users to make their own sets of cards?


!!! fix cards UI to always update based on selected filters


Card sets review for Agent:
Let's analyze topic coverage for a subdomain in our Kemmei card database.
Subdomain: 2.3
1. Read covmap file
2. Read transcript for that subdomain
3. Query Mongo for cards' question texts and tags for that subdomain
4. Identify missing topics
5. Decide on how many cards to make for each difficulty level/question type
