0:02
you'll often hear cloud computing
0:03
described as a server that's simply
0:06
hosted somewhere else but in reality
0:09
cloud computing provides extensive
0:11
functionality and we'll talk about some
0:13
of those advantages in this video today
0:16
it certainly allows us to take the
0:17
applications and services that normally
0:20
we would host in our own data center and
0:22
host those services anywhere we'd like
0:25
in the world one interesting
0:26
characteristic of cloud computing is
0:28
that these services are located at many
0:30
public cloud service providers which
0:33
means we have effectively as much CPU
0:36
drive space and network as we could
0:38
possibly want to use another powerful
0:41
characteristic of cloud computing is
0:43
that you can deploy an entire
0:45
application instance anywhere you'd like
0:47
at any time by simply pressing a button
0:50
this is very different than the old days
0:52
of physical data centers where you had
0:54
to purchase a server wait for that
0:56
purchase to arrive unbox the server put
0:59
it into a rack turn it on install the
1:02
operating system and the application and
1:04
finally connect it to a network just to
1:07
be able to use that app with cloud
1:09
computing all of this is done in a
1:11
matter of moments and you can deploy as
1:13
much or as little of this as you need
1:16
and of course as the demand for that app
1:18
tends to decrease over time you can
1:21
remove those resources from the cloud at
1:23
any moment many of these public clouds
1:26
are located in key geographical areas
1:29
around the world that means that you can
1:31
deploy your app to where it makes the
1:33
most sense if more people would use this
1:35
app in Europe then you may want to use a
1:37
Europebased cloud service provider if
1:40
more of your customers are in the United
1:42
States you may want to have some
1:44
US-based cloud services there the cloud
1:47
is also about efficiency if you only
1:49
have a particular application that you
1:51
need during particular times of the year
1:54
you can simply spin up those application
1:56
instances use that application and when
1:58
you're done you can turn off those
2:00
particular instances this means that you
2:03
now have more financial control over how
2:05
this application is deployed and you
2:07
don't have to put up a lot of money
2:09
upfront just to buy all of this
2:11
infrastructure instead you simply pay
2:13
over time by using the
2:15
cloud when most people think about the
2:17
cloud they probably think about a public
2:20
cloud these would be the cloud
2:21
infrastructures provided by Microsoft
2:24
Amazon Rackspace and many other cloud
2:26
providers we call these public clouds
2:29
because you're able to access these
2:30
clouds publicly from anywhere you happen
2:33
to be on the internet a private cloud is
2:36
a cloud infrastructure that you are
2:38
running in your own private data center
2:40
you would need to purchase all of the
2:42
equipment and storage required to build
2:44
that cloud but once that's in place in
2:46
your own infrastructure you can deploy
2:49
new applications use the capabilities of
2:51
these cloud-based infrastructures but
2:53
keep all of that information within your
2:55
control in your private data center many
2:58
organizations use a combination of both
3:01
of these they might have a private cloud
3:03
that they're running their own internal
3:05
and private apps on and they might also
3:07
have a public cloud that they use for
3:10
deployment and access by other folks on
3:12
the internet both of these are very
3:14
common implementations and in many
3:16
organizations you will see both of these
3:18
used
3:19
simultaneously the idea of purchasing
3:22
your own cloud and deploying it in your
3:24
own data center requires a bit of a cash
3:26
outlay so some organizations will
3:28
partner with other organizations that
3:30
provide a similar set of services and
3:33
build their own cloud that they can
3:35
share amongst all of them this means
3:37
that these smaller organizations can
3:39
still take advantage of the technologies
3:41
that cloud provides but it doesn't
3:43
require that enormous cash outlay to
3:46
begin
3:47
with not every cloud implementation is
3:50
designed in exactly the same way there
3:52
are a number of different implementation
3:54
models that you might find one of these
3:57
is infrastructure as a service or AAS
4:01
you might also see this referred to as
4:03
hardware as a service or HASS you can
4:06
think of this as renting time on a piece
4:08
of hardware that's somewhere in a cloud
4:11
infrastructure this means that the cloud
4:13
provider can provide you with a CPU and
4:16
storage space but you would still be
4:18
responsible for installing operating
4:20
systems maintaining the operating system
4:22
and keeping it up to date and
4:24
maintaining the security of the
4:25
application the cloud provider certainly
4:28
has access to the hardware that you're
4:30
using but all of that data that you're
4:32
storing would be within your control and
4:35
your control only this gives you some
4:37
additional security over other types of
4:39
cloud deployment models but it also
4:42
requires a lot more work to be able to
4:44
manage and maintain the system one
4:47
common use of an infrastructure as a
4:49
service deployment would be with
4:51
something like a web service provider
4:53
for example if you're on professor
4:55
messor.com right now you're using a
4:57
cloud-based server that was deployed in
4:59
an infrastructure as a service model i
5:02
simply rent time on those systems but
5:04
I'm responsible for maintaining the
5:06
operating system the applications and
5:08
the
5:09
data infrastructure as a service has a
5:12
significant management overhead
5:14
associated with it on the other side of
5:16
the spectrum would be software as a
5:19
service or SAS software as a service is
5:22
ondemand software you simply use your
5:24
username and password you log into a
5:27
system usually with a web-based front
5:28
end and you're able to take advantage of
5:31
that particular application you don't
5:33
have to do any type of management of the
5:35
application there's no operating system
5:37
updates you don't have to manage any
5:39
software applications or code and you
5:42
don't even have to worry about where the
5:43
data happens to be all of these
5:46
requirements are managed by the cloud
5:47
service provider through the software as
5:50
a service deployment model this also
5:52
means you don't need a big development
5:54
team to be able to write any
5:55
applications because the application has
5:58
already been written for you with
5:59
software as a service you would simply
6:02
log in and use that application and if
6:04
there's any updates that need to be made
6:06
to that application they are made by the
6:09
application provider themselves a good
6:11
example of a software as a service would
6:13
be things like Google Mail or Microsoft
6:16
365 where you don't have to build the
6:18
Google Mail infrastructure you simply
6:20
use your username and password and
6:22
you're able to send and receive
6:24
emails a deployment model that's in the
6:27
middle ground between infrastructure as
6:29
a service and software as a service is
6:32
one we refer to as platform as a service
6:35
or pass platform as a service doesn't
6:38
require you to maintain any operating
6:40
systems and you don't have to have your
6:42
own data center but you do have to work
6:44
on building the application that will
6:46
run on this particular platform this is
6:49
an interesting hybrid between the
6:51
software as a service model and the
6:53
infrastructure as a service model
6:55
because you still have to write the
6:57
application but the platform that you're
6:59
using to write and to run the software
7:02
is all operating on the platform used by
7:04
the platform as a service provider you
7:07
can think of piecing together different
7:09
modules of an application in the same
7:11
way that you might piece together
7:13
different types of building blocks you
7:15
determine how these building blocks are
7:17
arranged and ultimately what these
7:19
building blocks will provide for you but
7:21
it's your responsibility to put all of
7:23
these blocks together in a way that
7:24
makes sense for you and only you will
7:27
have access to this application because
7:29
you built it as part of this platform as
7:31
a service infrastructure there are many
7:34
different platform as a service
7:36
providers that you could choose from on
7:37
the internet one of the more popular
7:39
past providers is from Salesforce.com
7:42
many people know Salesforce as a
7:45
software as a service provider where you
7:47
simply log in and use their platform but
7:49
they also have an extensive development
7:51
platform that you're able to build your
7:53
own application to work exactly the way
7:55
you'd like and that particular arm of
7:58
Salesforce.com operates as platform as a
8:01
service
8:02
many public cloud providers will provide
8:05
you with a responsibility matrix so that
8:07
you know exactly what parts of this
8:09
service are managed by the cloud
8:11
provider and what parts of this service
8:13
are the responsibility of you the
8:15
customer for example if you're building
8:17
out your own cloud services or doing
8:19
everything on your own premises
8:22
effectively everything is your
8:23
responsibility you would need to be
8:25
responsible for the data the
8:27
infrastructure the applications that
8:29
you're building the network connectivity
8:31
the operating systems themselves and the
8:34
physical platform itself software as a
8:37
service is one where the provider is
8:39
managing a very large amount of that
8:41
infrastructure all the way from the
8:43
physical data center up through the
8:44
application itself you as the customer
8:47
may want to provide some additional
8:49
identity and directory infrastructure
8:50
for authentication you might want to
8:52
have your own accounts configured within
8:55
this software as a service platform and
8:57
you'll need to provide the computers the
8:59
tablets or the phones that will be used
9:01
to connect to this SAS provider with
9:04
platform as a service you as the
9:06
customer will be responsible for writing
9:08
your own applications the pass provider
9:10
will provide you with the platform and
9:12
you the customer will begin writing the
9:14
applications that will run on this
9:16
platform and with infrastructure as a
9:19
service the provider commonly provides
9:21
the data center the network connectivity
9:23
and the hardware for the CPU and the
9:25
storage you as the customer might have
9:28
the option for installing your own
9:29
operating system and as the customer you
9:31
will be responsible for everything else
9:34
that is being used on that cloud
9:36
deployment option

0:02
many organizations will build their own
0:04
private cloud they have their own data
0:06
center that they manage themselves they
0:08
will purchase their own equipment and
0:10
their own storage and they will install
0:12
and maintain everything themselves
0:15
sometimes you'll see this referred to as
0:17
an internal cloud or a private cloud all
0:20
of those resources in their private
0:22
cloud are dedicated for their use only
0:25
no one else will be using any of the
0:27
resources that they have acquired and
0:29
that they maintain in their own internal
0:32
cloud infrastructure there's obviously a
0:34
significant cash outlay to be able to
0:36
purchase all of this equipment initially
0:38
and install it into your data center but
0:41
once everything's in place you no longer
0:43
have those pay as you go or metered
0:46
costs associated with a cloud
0:48
infrastructure you can use as much of
0:50
your private cloud as you would like and
0:52
there's no additional cloud costs
0:54
associated with that some organizations
0:57
prefer not owning any equipment or
1:00
maintaining any data center and instead
1:02
will use a cloud that was created by
1:04
others in this case it would be an
1:06
external cloud or what we often refer to
1:08
as a public cloud so if you are using
1:11
public cloud services on Amazon on
1:14
Rackspace on Microsoft then all of those
1:17
cloud services would be considered a
1:19
public cloud there are many other
1:21
customers that are deploying their own
1:23
cloud-based services so both you and
1:26
those other customers are all sharing
1:28
the same resources to be able to deploy
1:31
all of those cloud-based technologies
1:33
obviously in these public clouds one
1:35
customer is not able to see any data
1:37
from another customer but all of you
1:39
could be using the same storage drives
1:42
the same CPUs and the same network as
1:44
every other customer in that public
1:46
cloud and although you didn't have to
1:48
pay for any additional costs up front to
1:50
put together this cloud you still have
1:53
to pay for the resources that you're
1:55
using some cloud providers charge you a
1:57
fixed rate per month or they might
1:59
charge as you go in more of a metered
2:01
pricing so your organization will need
2:04
to determine if a private cloud might be
2:06
something worth investing in or if a
2:08
public cloud might be a better
2:10
option for many organizations costs are
2:13
certainly an important consideration and
2:15
with cloud services you could be build
2:18
differently depending on the cloud
2:20
provider and the service that you're
2:21
using you may find that some of your
2:23
cloud services are build back to you
2:26
using metered utilization this means
2:28
that you as the customer are paying for
2:30
how much of these resources you are
2:32
using so if you're paying to have
2:34
traffic uploaded to you inside of this
2:37
cloud all of that traffic would be
2:39
ingress traffic and there may be a cost
2:41
associated with every bite that you
2:43
would transfer of that ingress traffic
2:46
there's probably also a cost to store
2:48
the data on the storage drives of that
2:50
cloud-based service and if customers are
2:52
downloading information from your cloud
2:54
services then you are sending that
2:56
information to the user and all of that
2:58
information would be priced on the
3:01
egress traffic costs and if customers
3:03
are downloading information from your
3:05
cloud services then you are sending all
3:07
of that traffic out or it would be
3:09
egress traffic and there might be a
3:12
different cost for egress traffic versus
3:15
ingress traffic at the end of the month
3:17
all of these costs are added up and they
3:19
provide you with an invoice of what you
3:21
would need to pay for that month if you
3:23
have a very busy month then you probably
3:25
are paying more than if it's a slower
3:27
month because it is a metered
3:29
utilization or based on how much you're
3:32
using on the consumer side we tend to
3:35
see a lot of cloud-based services priced
3:37
on a non-metered basis this means that
3:40
it is a fixed price for a certain amount
3:43
of resources and those services
3:45
generally charge you based on the
3:47
maximum amount of storage that you could
3:49
use for example you might pay a certain
3:51
amount for 2 GB of storage in the cloud
3:54
and no matter how much you upload or how
3:56
much you download you're always paying
3:58
the same amount every month for that
4:00
maximum block of storage
4:03
one of the most useful characteristics
4:04
of cloud computing is the ability to
4:07
scale up or scale down at any time this
4:10
means as customers or applications
4:12
become more active you can scale up your
4:14
infrastructure to be able to handle that
4:16
load and perhaps at different times of
4:19
the year when things get a little bit
4:20
slower you can scale down your
4:23
infrastructure so you're only paying for
4:25
what you need and of course you're able
4:27
to make these changes at any time and
4:30
very often automatically so it would not
4:32
be unusual for you to push a button and
4:35
instantly deploy a new application
4:37
instance to be able to handle the
4:39
additional load we refer to this ability
4:41
to instantly scale up or scale down
4:44
based on the load as
4:46
elasticity another very appealing
4:48
characteristic of cloud technologies is
4:51
that it always seems to be available
4:53
this ability to maintain uptime and
4:55
availability is an important
4:56
characteristic for any infrastructure
4:59
but with cloud-based technologies there
5:01
are many redundancies in place across
5:03
many different data centers this means
5:05
if one data center is having problems
5:07
with a particular drive array or with a
5:09
network connection that other parts of
5:11
that infrastructure can pick up the load
5:13
and in very extreme cases some of these
5:16
cloud providers will have completely
5:18
separate data centers and they can move
5:20
everyone from one data center to the
5:22
other to maintain that
5:24
uptime the cloud also allows us to
5:27
appear to be everywhere all at once this
5:30
means that we can have a database that
5:32
we're maintaining here in North America
5:35
and be able to have that information
5:37
automatically duplicated to other data
5:39
centers around the world sometimes this
5:41
file synchronization is something built
5:43
into the application and is maintained
5:45
by the customer but some cloud
5:47
infrastructures will automatically
5:49
synchronize this data behind the scenes
5:51
especially if they need to move you from
5:53
one data center to another and to be
5:56
able to get the best efficiency for the
5:58
infrastructure that's been installed in
6:00
these cloud-based data centers we need
6:02
to have many customers using all of this
6:05
equipment all the time we refer to this
6:07
characteristic as multi-tenency that
6:10
means there are many different tenants
6:12
effectively living in that cloud
6:14
infrastructure and they are all working
6:16
and operating simultaneously across all
6:19
of those resources there are obviously
6:22
technologies processes and procedures in
6:25
place to maintain separation between all
6:27
of these different customers but by
6:29
having all of these customers use all of
6:31
these cloud-based services
6:33
simultaneously the cloud provider can
6:35
provide an efficiency in technology and
6:37
an efficiency in cost
