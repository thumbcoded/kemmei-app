if you were to look around at the
0:03
different computing platforms that we
0:05
use we have our larger desktop computers
0:07
but you might also have much smaller
0:10
computer perhaps one that you would use
0:11
in a small office or one that you would
0:14
use next to your television both of
0:16
these have the same type of components
0:18
inside there's CPU memory storage
0:22
network connections and other components
0:24
that are very similar between these two
0:27
platforms but obviously these platforms
0:29
are very different in their total
0:31
footprint the desktop computer is much
0:34
larger and the computer next to our
0:36
media center or that we use at work is a
0:38
much smaller system obviously the
0:41
motherboard in this much smaller system
0:43
is not going to be the same form factor
0:46
so it is useful to make some
0:47
differentiations between one type of
0:50
motherboard and another
0:53
physical size is certainly something to
0:55
consider when you're looking at
0:56
different motherboards we also have to
0:58
look at the overall layout of the
1:00
components that are on the motherboard
1:02
itself larger motherboards tend to have
1:04
more flexibility and can have a larger
1:07
number of components than a smaller
1:09
motherboard we also have to think about
1:11
power fortunately most motherboards have
1:13
a standard power connection but not all
1:15
motherboards have exactly the same power
1:18
connection we have to think about air
1:20
flow all of these systems do get warm
1:22
and we need to make sure that whatever
1:24
cooling system we use is able to keep up
1:26
with the heat that's being generated by
1:28
this motherboard fortunately we don't
1:31
have to memorize or know about every
1:33
possible motherboard that was ever
1:35
created if we look at Wikipedia there
1:37
are over 40 different motherboard types
1:40
fortunately for your A+ certification
1:43
you'll only need to focus on
1:44
understanding three of those 40 if you
1:47
were to look at the objectives they
1:49
state section 3.5 says given a scenario
1:52
install and configure motherboards
1:55
central processing units CPUs and add-on
1:58
cards this is one where we need to focus
2:01
on what the exam objectives themselves
2:04
are expecting us to know we need to know
2:07
which motherboard we would choose for
2:09
any particular scenario so if you're
2:12
putting a motherboard in a media center
2:14
you might need one type of motherboard
2:16
which is very different than a
2:17
motherboard you might use on a desktop
2:19
computer to perform video editing for
2:22
the purposes of the A+ exam we need to
2:25
understand the nuances between the ATX
2:28
motherboard the microATX motherboard and
2:31
the ITX
2:33
motherboard here's a one-page summary of
2:35
all three of those motherboard types the
2:38
standard ATX is one that is the largest
2:41
on this particular screen and we'll talk
2:43
more about why that tends to be a much
2:46
larger motherboard type in the middle is
2:48
the MicroATX which is very similar in
2:51
its layout to the standard ATX albeit a
2:54
bit smaller and then on the smaller side
2:56
is the mini ITX which is the smallest of
3:00
these three the ATX form factor stands
3:03
for advanced technology extended it's a
3:06
standard that's been around for a very
3:08
long time since
3:10
1995 there have been a number of changes
3:12
to the ATX standard over the years but
3:14
the current version of ATX is very
3:16
similar to the one that was released
3:18
back then the main power on the ATX
3:21
motherboard has changed a bit over time
3:23
early versions of the ATX standard had a
3:26
20 pin connector for the main system
3:28
board power more modern versions have a
3:31
24 pin connector this is an ATX
3:34
motherboard from Gigabyte it's the GA
3:37
P67A
3:40
UD3PB3 you can see that this motherboard
3:42
is rather large it has a number of
3:44
expansion slots on it this one has four
3:47
separate memory slots for adding
3:49
additional memory and you can see the
3:51
CPU is in the middle of the motherboard
3:54
make a note of these relative sizes
3:56
between the CPU the memory slots and the
3:58
expansion card slots because we'll want
4:01
to compare them when looking at other
4:03
motherboard types
4:05
the microATX is very similar in layout
4:08
to the ATX motherboard but it is
4:10
slightly smaller than that ATX standard
4:13
this also has a lot of similarities to
4:15
ATX for example the mounting points on
4:18
this motherboard are at exactly the same
4:20
points as the mounting points on a
4:22
full-size ATX motherboard this also has
4:25
the same power connectors as the
4:27
full-size ATX motherboard and this is
4:30
another popular form factor primarily
4:32
because it does follow the same
4:34
standards as ATX but it does fit into a
4:37
much smaller form factor this microATX
4:40
motherboard is the MSI
4:44
H81MP33 you can see that this has a
4:46
similar layout to the full-size ATX but
4:49
this does have a limited number of
4:51
resources for example this microATX
4:54
motherboard only has a single expansion
4:57
slot and it only has two memory slots
4:59
available obviously the ATX motherboard
5:02
is much larger and we're able to fit
5:04
more components onto the larger
5:06
motherboard when we shrink these down
5:08
into the microATX size we have to make
5:11
decisions about what components we're
5:13
going to keep on this motherboard and
5:15
what components are not going to make
5:16
the cut and if you're looking for a very
5:20
small-sized motherboard you might want
5:21
to consider an ITX motherboard this ITX
5:25
motherboard you see on the screen is a
5:27
mini ITX which is one of the smallest
5:29
versions of the ITX format you can see
5:32
that the miniITX motherboard is a
5:35
relatively small board but they did keep
5:38
the same mounting screw points as a
5:40
traditional ATX motherboard that means
5:42
we could take the case that was designed
5:44
for an ATX motherboard and install a
5:47
mini ITX motherboard inside of that case
5:50
this very small form factor makes a
5:52
perfect size if you need to fit it into
5:55
a very tight area so if you need a
5:57
streaming media device that's next to
5:59
your television or you just need a
6:01
single computer that handles one single
6:04
task this might be the right motherboard
6:06
for you


if you were to look at a motherboard it
0:04
almost seems like a small city that's
0:06
seen from the air there are a lot of
0:08
different areas of the motherboard and
0:10
it seems like there is some type of
0:12
connectivity between all of these
0:14
different components that connectivity
0:16
is what we refer to as a computer bus
0:19
this bus is a pathway that connects the
0:22
different components of your motherboard
0:23
to each other for example there's a bus
0:26
between your memory slots and your CPU
0:28
there's also a bus that connects all of
0:30
your expansion slots these different
0:32
buses allow us to connect all of these
0:35
very diverse components on the
0:36
motherboard to each other so that they
0:38
work as one single unit these buses also
0:42
allow us to increase the functionality
0:43
of our motherboard for example the buses
0:46
that connect all of the different
0:47
expansion slots together allow us to put
0:50
additional cards onto our motherboard
0:53
thereby increasing the functionality of
0:55
that system if you were to look closely
0:57
at your motherboard you can see the
0:59
individual buses or pathways that are
1:02
used to move information from one part
1:04
of the motherboard to another and if
1:06
you're curious you could trace one end
1:08
of a bus connection all the way around
1:10
the motherboard to where it connects on
1:12
the other
1:13
side on older motherboards you may find
1:16
that one of the buses available is a PCI
1:19
bus this stands for peripheral component
1:22
interconnect this is one that was
1:24
created in 1994 and has two different
1:27
sizes a 32-bit bus and a 64-bit PCI bus
1:32
this older style bus sends data over a
1:34
parallel communication you may find that
1:37
your newer motherboard no longer has a
1:39
PCI bus and instead uses PCI Express
1:43
which has a serial form of communication
1:46
we mentioned that there are two sizes to
1:48
the PCI bus there's the 32-bit and the
1:51
64-bit the 32-bit PCI bus is shown here
1:55
and you can see there are 32 separate
1:58
connections between the different
1:59
devices this means when you want to send
2:01
32 bits that one bit at a time is sent
2:04
across this 32-bit bus all
2:07
simultaneously and hopefully all 32 of
2:10
those bits will appear at the same time
2:12
on the other side a 64-bit bus is
2:15
exactly the same form of communication
2:17
but instead of sending 32 bits across 32
2:21
separate lines you send 64 bits over 64
2:25
separate lines in this PCI bus this is
2:28
an example of a 32bit PCI bus and a
2:32
64-bit PCI bus this is where you would
2:35
plug in your expansion cards and if you
2:37
look closely at the motherboard you can
2:39
see all of these small traces that are
2:41
connecting these different bus
2:42
connections together you'll notice on
2:44
these slots that there are small tabs or
2:47
keys that are in the middle of this
2:49
connector those are to designate
2:51
different power settings for the adapter
2:54
cards that you're plugging in for
2:55
example your expansion cards will have
2:57
these small slots that are in the
2:59
connector and that's what's sliding into
3:02
those adapter card slots on the
3:04
motherboard a 64-bit expansion card has
3:07
additional connectors on the bottom and
3:10
it has a separate keyway that designates
3:12
that this is a 64-bit expansion card
3:16
installing an adapter card onto a
3:18
motherboard simply requires that you
3:20
push the card directly into that slot so
3:23
if you have a PCI slot you would simply
3:25
put the adapter card right on top of the
3:27
slot so that all of those individual
3:30
keyways are properly aligned and then
3:32
you would push the card down very
3:34
carefully onto the motherboard being
3:36
very careful not to give too much
3:38
pressure or you might end up breaking
3:40
components on that motherboard once it's
3:42
pushed in you can see that it fits
3:44
relatively snugly this one should
3:46
probably be pushed in just a little bit
3:47
further so that you can no longer see
3:50
any of those copper connections but once
3:52
it's in place it's commonly screwed down
3:54
onto the computer case so that it can't
3:57
accidentally be removed from that slot
4:00
pci Express or PCIe is a newer type of
4:04
bus and this is probably the bus type
4:07
you'll find on the most recent computers
4:09
pci Express communicates over a serial
4:12
connection this is very different than
4:14
the parallel pathways we saw with PCI
4:17
because with PCI Express and a serial
4:19
connection we're simply sending one bit
4:22
at a time over the same pathway you'll
4:25
often hear us refer to these PCI Express
4:28
pathways as lanes of communication so if
4:31
you're looking at a motherboard and
4:33
there is an interface labeled PCIe X1
4:37
it's referring to the number of lanes
4:39
available for that particular interface
4:41
the X1 is pronounced BY1 x2 would be by
4:45
2 by 4 by 8 and so on so when we're
4:48
looking at that PCIe ex1 this is really
4:52
a PCI Express interface with a BY1
4:56
connection since the pathways that we
4:59
use to communicate for PCI Express are
5:01
serial we don't have to have those wide
5:04
32bit or 64-bit pathways we can simply
5:07
have one pathway going one direction and
5:10
one pathway going the other direction
5:12
this would be referred to as a PCI
5:14
Express by one lane where you have a
5:16
single lane going one way and a single
5:18
lane going the other that means if you
5:21
wanted a PCI Express by four lanes you
5:24
would have four of those and you would
5:26
effectively be quadrupling the amount of
5:28
throughput that you could have compared
5:30
to a PCI by
5:32
one here's a motherboard that has both
5:35
PCI interfaces and PCI Express on the
5:38
same motherboard you'll notice that they
5:40
look very similar to each other but if
5:43
you look closer you'll notice that the
5:45
keyway for PCI is further back away from
5:48
the edge of the motherboard and for PCI
5:50
Express that keyway is closer to the
5:53
edge of the motherboard you'll also
5:55
notice that the size of the slots may be
5:58
different depending on the bus type for
6:00
example this is the shortest PCI
6:02
interface this is a 32-bit interface and
6:05
this is the shortest PCI Express
6:08
interface which is the by one interface
6:11
this means if we only need the
6:12
throughput provided by a PCI BY1
6:15
interface we can use that smaller
6:17
connection and save that room on our
6:20
motherboard the PCI Express interface
6:23
cards look very similar to the PCI
6:25
interface cards but if you look closer
6:28
you'll notice you have that keyway
6:30
that's closer to the edge of the
6:31
motherboard many of these PCI Express
6:34
adapter cards also have a small hook on
6:36
the back of the interface cards that fit
6:38
into a connector that's on the
6:40
motherboard this fastens the card down
6:43
not only at the keyway that's connected
6:45
to the chassis of the computer case but
6:48
it also connects it to the motherboard
6:49
itself when you're removing a PCI
6:52
Express card from the motherboard you
6:54
want to be sure that you're not only
6:55
removing the screw that's connecting it
6:57
to the case of the computer but you also
7:00
unlatch that connector that's holding it
7:02
in on the other side

if you look closely at your motherboard
0:03
you'll see a number of different
0:05
components for CPU and memory but you'll
0:08
also see a relatively large connector
0:10
and that's used for the main power for
0:13
your motherboard this is the connector
0:15
that provides 3.3 volt 5V and 12vt DC
0:19
power to your motherboard and the
0:21
components connected to your motherboard
0:24
if you're working with an older
0:25
motherboard this may be a 20 pin
0:28
connector but newer motherboards use 24
0:31
pins to provide the power that it needs
0:33
if you have a motherboard with 20 pins
0:36
but you have a connector with 24 pins
0:39
you can often simply use that same 24
0:42
pin connector even though four pins may
0:44
be missing from the connector that's on
0:46
your motherboard some of the cables from
0:48
your power supply may even be modular so
0:51
you can pull off four of those
0:52
connectors and simply use the 20 that
0:55
are left here's the 24 pin connector on
0:58
the motherboard you'll notice that the
1:00
individual pins on the connector have
1:02
different shapes this keying ensures
1:05
that you can only plug the main power
1:07
connector in one single way to that
1:10
connection and if you were to look at
1:12
the connector coming from the power
1:13
supply you will see that it has the same
1:16
type of keying mechanism on the
1:18
connector to plug this into the
1:20
motherboard you simply line up those
1:22
keys in the proper order and push the
1:24
connector all the way into the
1:26
motherboard normally this connector will
1:28
have a lip or locking mechanism so that
1:31
when you connect this to the motherboard
1:33
it can only be removed if you unlock it
1:36
with the latch
1:38
normally that connector to the
1:39
motherboard provides all the power we
1:41
need but often you may install an
1:43
adapter card that requires additional
1:46
power than what the motherboard is
1:48
already providing this is very common if
1:50
you're plugging in a graphics card or
1:52
some other device that needs additional
1:55
power over what the motherboard can
1:56
provide this is a PCI Express 8pin and
2:00
six pin connector the six pin version of
2:03
this provides 75 watts and the 8 pin
2:06
provides 150 watts of 12volt DC power we
2:10
often associate this with video adapter
2:12
cards but any other kind of adapter that
2:15
needs that additional power may have
2:17
connectors on it for that PCI Express
2:19
connector some of these PCI Express
2:22
connectors like this one can be an
2:23
eightpin connector but you can also pull
2:26
off two of the pins on the side so that
2:28
you can use it as a six pin connector
2:30
for those types of devices for example
2:33
if you're installing a video card in a
2:35
motherboard you may notice on the top of
2:37
the video card are additional power
2:39
connectors this adapter card has a power
2:42
connector with six additional links
2:45
which means that we'll want to use the
2:46
six additional pins that are available
2:48
from the power supply to give additional
2:51
power to this video card if you've ever
2:54
connected a storage device to your
2:56
motherboard you may be familiar with the
2:58
SATA drive interfaces these interfaces
3:01
are used to provide data connectivity to
3:03
these SATA drives the connectors
3:06
themselves have this L-shape associated
3:08
with them and this provides only the
3:11
data connection some other boards may
3:13
have an ESATA connector or an external
3:16
SATA connection or it may be integrated
3:18
into an adapter card this is an ESATA
3:21
expansion card that plugs into the bus
3:23
of the computer and provides two
3:25
additional ESATA connectors on the
3:28
outside of the computer here's the view
3:30
of those interfaces installed onto the
3:33
back of a desktop computer
3:35
another connector type you would find on
3:37
a motherboard is one that has a number
3:39
of pins that are sticking up from the
3:41
motherboard itself we refer to these as
3:44
headers or pin headers this is a
3:46
relatively simple electrical interface
3:48
that's commonly used to connect a number
3:50
of different devices to your motherboard
3:52
for example you may be plugging in
3:54
speakers or you may be connecting power
3:56
buttons or USB interfaces that are on
3:59
your computer case here's an example of
4:02
some pin headers that are available on a
4:04
motherboard these pin headers appear to
4:06
support ATPM or trusted platform module
4:09
there is some version one or version two
4:12
USB connections and there are also USB
4:15
3.0 connections also all as pin headers
4:19
on this motherboard sometimes these pin
4:21
headers are associated with a single
4:23
pair of wires you can see these front
4:25
panel connectors that are used for a
4:27
reset switch or a hard drive light you
4:30
would connect those to the pin headers
4:32
that are on a motherboard and usually
4:33
they're marked on the motherboard itself
4:36
for example you might plug into a pin
4:38
header for power buttons reset buttons
4:41
and other LED lights this makes it very
4:43
easy to connect different buttons
4:45
interfaces and lights that may be on
4:47
your computer case to their appropriate
4:49
connection on your
4:51
motherboard another popular storage
4:53
connection on your motherboard is one
4:55
that is relatively small you have to
4:57
look very closely to be able to find the
5:00
M.2 connector that might be on your
5:02
motherboard you can see the M.2
5:04
connectors are on this motherboard and
5:06
they're relatively small especially when
5:08
you compare them to the flash drive that
5:10
you might be connecting to that
5:12
interface these M.2 interfaces are
5:15
relatively modular if you have a flash
5:17
drive like this one you simply need to
5:19
look for the M.2 connection on your
5:21
motherboard and push it directly into
5:23
that particular slot and then to
5:25
complete the installation you simply
5:27
fasten down the flash drive and now
5:29
you've connected an M.2 drive to that
5:32
interface on your motherboard

in the world of personal computer
0:03
central processing units or CPUs there
0:07
are two major companies in this space
0:09
there's Intel and AMD both companies
0:13
make processors that are compatible with
0:15
each other but there are some subtle
0:18
differences between the two
0:20
organizations many people consider AMD
0:23
an organization that makes CPUs that are
0:25
compatible with Intel but tend to be at
0:28
a lower price point so if you're putting
0:30
together a system and you're trying to
0:32
get the lowest price possible you might
0:34
want to consider AMD CPUs the physical
0:38
size of the processors made by Intel or
0:41
AMD tend to be relatively similar to
0:44
each other but the connectivity that you
0:46
would have on your motherboard is very
0:48
different depending on the CPU that
0:50
you're using so if you're planning to
0:52
use an AMD CPU you'll need a motherboard
0:55
that has an AMD socket if you're
0:57
planning to use an Intel CPU then you'll
1:00
need a different motherboard that has an
1:02
Intel socket traditionally we've looked
1:05
at these two companies as AMD as the
1:08
lowcost leader and Intel as the highest
1:11
performing processor this is a very
1:14
generalized description of these two
1:16
organizations and if you're putting
1:17
together a computer you may find that
1:19
Intel has a better priced processor and
1:22
AMD has a better performance processor
1:26
these two companies are in competition
1:28
with each other and we tend to see these
1:30
specifications switch from one
1:32
manufacturer to another manufacturer
1:34
quite often whether you're using an
1:37
Intel or an AMD CPU the process of
1:40
installing the CPU is relatively
1:42
straightforward most processor slots
1:44
don't require any type of force to be
1:46
able to install the processor you simply
1:48
place the CPU on top of the socket and
1:51
then close the cover and lock it down
1:53
with a handle that's provided you don't
1:56
have to force the CPU or add any
1:58
additional pressure to install the CPU
2:00
into its socket we're used to having a
2:03
single processor in our laptops our
2:06
desktops and other devices that we would
2:08
use as workstations but if you have a
2:10
server there may be a need to have
2:12
additional processing power and for that
2:15
reason you'll find many servers are
2:17
multis-ocket this means there are
2:19
separate physical CPUs that can be
2:21
installed on the same motherboard you'll
2:24
also notice that many server
2:25
motherboards also support multiple
2:27
memory module slots so at least four
2:30
slots and sometimes even more are
2:32
available to maximize the amount of RAM
2:34
that you can install on that single
2:36
system server motherboards also
2:39
generally support multiple expansion
2:41
slots so that you can customize the
2:43
server for any particular use and if
2:46
you're installing a server motherboard
2:47
you'll notice that they are designed to
2:49
fit into a 19-in rack and therefore tend
2:52
to use the full-size ATX
2:54
motherboard here's a good example of a
2:57
server motherboard you can see that
2:58
there are six separate memory slots you
3:01
have plenty of slots available for
3:03
additional expansion and this particular
3:05
motherboard supports two separate
3:07
physical CPUs if you need a server with
3:10
plenty of CPU processing and lots of
3:13
memory then you might want to consider a
3:15
motherboard that is specifically
3:16
designed for a server


when you start your computer you may
0:03
notice that the information you're
0:05
seeing on your screen is not related to
0:07
the operating system that ultimately
0:09
loads What you're seeing on the screen
0:12
is the BIOS the basic input output
0:15
system of your computer You might also
0:17
see this referred to as the firmware of
0:20
your system And some people refer to
0:22
this as the system BIOS or ROM BIOS
0:25
which is referring to read only memory
0:28
These days we don't generally use read
0:30
only memory to store the BIOS software
0:33
Instead it's usually stored on your
0:35
motherboard in flash memory The BIOS is
0:38
responsible for initializing your system
0:40
and getting everything ready to run with
0:42
the operating system that you need to
0:44
load The process you see when you start
0:47
your computer is referred to as the
0:49
power on self- test or post This checks
0:52
for a CPU make sure that you have memory
0:55
installed in the system that a keyboard
0:57
and a mouse is connected And if there
0:59
are any problems initializing those core
1:02
systems you'll see an error message on
1:04
your screen This process only takes a
1:07
few seconds and once this diagnostic is
1:09
done it begins to start your operating
1:11
system This may begin immediately
1:13
loading your operating system or you may
1:15
receive a prompt requesting you to
1:17
choose which operating system you'd like
1:19
to use This prompt is the bootloadader
1:22
and it signifies that you've completed
1:23
the post and is now ready to load the
1:26
operating system As we mentioned earlier
1:29
this BIOS software that starts your
1:31
system is usually stored in flash memory
1:33
on your motherboard And if you look
1:35
closely at your motherboard it's
1:36
probably even marked On this motherboard
1:39
there are two separate BIOS flash chips
1:42
one that is a main BIOS and one that is
1:44
a backup This allows you to upgrade the
1:46
BIOS but still keep another copy on
1:49
standby in case something happens during
1:51
the upgrade
1:52
process On older PCs you may find that
1:55
the BIOS is a traditional or legacy BIOS
1:59
This is a BIOS type that's been around
2:00
for more than 25 years And if you are
2:03
running an older operating system on an
2:05
older piece of hardware you're probably
2:08
using this legacy BIOS Unfortunately
2:10
this older legacy BIOS was designed for
2:13
older legacy hardware So if you're
2:16
trying to install newer hardware in an
2:18
older system you may find that the
2:20
legacy BIOS is not able to support that
2:23
hardware This is the type of textbased
2:26
screen that you would see on a legacy
2:28
BIOS This is one that uses your mouse
2:30
keys to be able to move around and you
2:33
would choose the inner keys or space
2:34
keys or perhaps a number of different
2:36
function keys to change what's on the
2:39
screen You'll notice there are options
2:40
available at the bottom of the screen so
2:42
you always know what choices you're able
2:44
to make on that particular
2:46
screen Our modern hardware needs a
2:49
modern BIOS And if you're using a more
2:52
modern computer you're probably using a
2:54
UEFI BIOS That UEFI stands for a unified
2:58
extensible firmware interface This is a
3:01
standard that was created by Intel And
3:03
you'll find that the UEFI BIOS is used
3:05
on all modern systems Because this is a
3:08
standard you'll find that the UEFI
3:11
functionality is very similar across
3:13
manufacturers So it doesn't matter who
3:15
manufactures your computer you'll find
3:17
that the options and features available
3:20
in your UEFI BIOS will be the same from
3:22
one manufacturer to another There are
3:25
also a number of new user interface
3:27
features in this UEFI BIOS You'll notice
3:29
that there are graphical options and you
3:32
can use your mouse to be able to move
3:33
around and manipulate the information
3:36
that's on the screen
3:38
The settings that you'll find within the
3:40
UEFI BIOS are the things that you might
3:42
expect for getting your system up and
3:44
running and ready to load an operating
3:46
system Things like an overview of the
3:48
CPU and the type of BIOS that you're
3:50
running You can see different devices
3:53
that may be connected to your computer
3:54
especially storage devices audio and
3:57
network You have advanced settings which
3:59
allow you to configure CPU features
4:02
especially those related to
4:03
virtualization There are power options
4:06
security startup and so much more Some
4:09
of these settings are critical to ensure
4:11
that your system will continue to
4:13
perform reliably So these are not
4:15
settings that you want to change or
4:17
modify without knowing exactly what the
4:20
result of that change is going to be If
4:22
you're planning to make any updates to
4:24
your BIOS it's important that you make
4:26
backups and have documentation just in
4:28
case you need to go back to the previous
4:30
configuration

during this video we're going to look at
0:03
a number of different settings inside of
0:05
our system BIOS if you'd like to look at
0:08
your own BIOS you can launch it when the
0:10
system starts up usually there is a
0:12
function key or special key you push on
0:14
your keyboard as your system is booting
0:17
and if your system recognizes that
0:18
you've pushed that key it will launch
0:20
the BIOS setup program very commonly
0:23
this key is the delete key an F1 key an
0:26
F2 key or it might be a combination of
0:29
keystrokes such as Ctrl S or Ctrl Alt S
0:33
some desktop hypervisors also allow you
0:36
to stop the VM from booting to go into
0:39
the BIOS settings for that virtual
0:41
machine if you're in Windows 10 or
0:43
Windows 11 you can use HyperV for this
0:46
or you can use thirdparty hypervisors
0:48
such as VMware Workstation if you're
0:50
running Mac OS you could run VMware
0:52
Fusion and if you'd like to download
0:54
either of those you can go directly to
0:56
the VMware website or you can use our
0:59
link at professor
1:02
messor.link/vmware to also go to that
1:04
page unfortunately if you're using
1:06
Virtual Box as your hypervisor it does
1:09
not support this virtual BIOS
1:11
configuration so you may want to use a
1:13
hypervisor that does provide that
1:15
functionality or you may want to use an
1:18
actual physical computer and a solution
1:20
that doesn't use any hypervisor or
1:23
physical computer is to find a simulator
1:26
of a BIOS online there are many
1:28
available simply search for UEFI BIOS
1:31
simulator and you'll have many options
1:33
to choose from if you're running Windows
1:36
10 and Windows 11 you may notice that
1:38
when you start your computer you don't
1:40
receive any prompts to push any special
1:42
keys to start a BIOS that's because
1:45
these versions of Windows don't actually
1:48
power all the way down when you turn
1:50
your computer off this is because they
1:52
use a feature known as fast startup this
1:56
means that your system only partially
1:58
shuts down so that when you turn it back
2:00
on it can start up that much faster
2:02
unfortunately this also means that it
2:05
does not start the BIOS setup process so
2:08
there's no opportunity to press the key
2:10
and enter the BIOS configuration if
2:12
you'd like to tell Windows to shut down
2:14
completely so that you can then start
2:16
this BIOS configuration you can hold
2:18
down the shift key when clicking restart
2:21
or you can choose settings update and
2:23
security recovery advanced startup and
2:26
restart now you can also make temporary
2:29
changes to this inside of the MS Config
2:32
utility that is the system configuration
2:34
utility in Windows and if none of these
2:37
options are available to you one way
2:39
that you can prevent fast startup from
2:41
working is to interrupt the boot process
2:44
three times in a row and if you do that
2:47
the fourth time through the boot process
2:48
will begin from the very beginning this
2:51
may not be obvious when you're
2:52
restarting Windows but if you're someone
2:54
who does need to make a BIOS change on a
2:56
production system you may find that you
2:58
have to restart the system at least
3:00
three times before you even have the
3:03
option before we get into the
3:05
configurations of the BIOS let me warn
3:07
you that making a change to a BIOS could
3:10
result in a system not booting or not
3:12
being stable for that reason we
3:14
recommend that if you're making any
3:16
changes to your BIOS configuration that
3:18
you document all of the changes that you
3:21
made one very easy way is to simply
3:23
write down what the change might be or
3:26
if you have your phone with you you
3:27
might want to take a picture of the
3:28
screen before you make that change it's
3:31
also a good idea to have an
3:33
understanding of exactly what you're
3:35
changing in the BIOS most of the
3:37
settings are relatively straightforward
3:39
but there are some configurations
3:41
dealing with memory and CPU that may be
3:44
difficult to understand so it's
3:46
important that you don't randomly make
3:47
changes to these configurations because
3:50
it could cause problems with either the
3:52
startup process or the ongoing
3:54
reliability of the system and as many of
3:57
you know I'm a big proponent of backups
3:59
so if you are planning to make any
4:01
changes to your BIOS make sure that you
4:04
have a backup of that configuration that
4:06
you can always revert
4:08
to the BIOS is some of the first
4:11
software that runs on your computer when
4:13
you hit the power button the BIOS will
4:15
take over and look at all of the
4:17
configuration settings that you've made
4:19
for this device for example you can
4:22
disable hardware inside of the BIOS and
4:24
when you load your operating system
4:26
you'll see that the operating system has
4:28
no idea that that hardware exists that's
4:31
because the BIOS is that connection to
4:33
the hardware and if we disable that
4:35
connection your operating system has no
4:37
idea how to access that hardware the
4:40
BIOS is also where you configure the
4:42
boot order for your system there are a
4:44
lot of different ways that you could
4:46
boot your system and you probably have a
4:48
number of different storage devices that
4:50
you could boot from you might have
4:51
multiple SSDs inside of your system you
4:54
might have USB connections that you can
4:56
plug in and any one of those could be
4:59
used as a boot device you have to
5:01
configure your BIOS to tell it which
5:03
device it will try to boot from first
5:06
and if there's no operating system on
5:07
that drive which one you'll boot from
5:09
second if there's no operating system on
5:11
that drive which you'll boot from third
5:13
and so on i'm using an emulated BIOS to
5:17
demonstrate some of these capabilities
5:19
so if you see a number of unusual
5:21
settings such as an invalid serial
5:23
number or a MAC address of all X's
5:26
you'll know why let's look at the boot
5:28
configuration on this particular system
5:31
we'll go to the option in our menu
5:33
called startup and in our startup system
5:35
the very first option is the primary
5:38
boot sequence which determines what
5:40
sequence will be used when the system
5:42
starts up you can see there are a number
5:45
of different drives inside of this
5:47
virtual system there's a number of SATA
5:49
drives there's an M.2 drive you've got a
5:52
network connection and USB drives and
5:54
you can use any of these as the boot
5:57
sequence the BIOS allows us to select
5:59
any of these available drives and move
6:01
it up or down in this list to determine
6:04
where it sits in the overall boot
6:06
sequence for example if you have a USB
6:09
drive that you'd like to boot from
6:11
you'll need to move that up to the very
6:12
top so that it's one of the first drives
6:14
accessed during the boot process or
6:17
perhaps you've installed a new M.2 drive
6:19
and you may need to move that up higher
6:21
in the sequence so that it becomes the
6:23
first drive access during the boot
6:26
process we mentioned earlier that the
6:28
BIOS allows you to enable and disable
6:31
different hardware and a good example of
6:33
that is the USB connections that you
6:35
have on your computer those USB drives
6:38
allow us to plug in storage devices in
6:40
some cases very large capacity storage
6:43
devices and some organizations have
6:45
security teams that would like to
6:47
restrict access to those USB storage
6:49
devices this creates a bit of a
6:52
balancing act of course because those
6:53
USB drives are very convenient and very
6:56
fast especially if you need to move
6:58
information from one system to another
7:00
unfortunately there have been cases
7:02
where a USB drive could be used to cause
7:06
problems on a network a good example of
7:08
this is in 2008 when the United States
7:11
Department of Defense banned all USB
7:14
flash drives on all of their systems and
7:17
it extended this ban for 15 months
7:20
that's because someone brought in a USB
7:23
drive plugged it in to a Department of
7:25
Defense computer and it infected itself
7:27
with the silly FDC worm which then
7:31
infected all of the other systems in the
7:34
Department of Defense network for that
7:36
reason the system administrators at the
7:38
Department of Defense went into the BIOS
7:40
of their systems and disabled the USB
7:44
drives in our BIOS the USB configuration
7:47
is under devices and it's the option
7:49
that says USB setup in here you can
7:52
enable or disable interfaces change what
7:55
type of support you're enabling for
7:57
those devices change which exact port is
8:00
enabled and which one is disabled and
8:03
make a number of different configuration
8:05
options to the USB settings
8:08
many of our computers have cooling
8:10
systems inside primarily because it can
8:13
get very warm inside of that computer
8:15
case the CPU puts off a lot of heat and
8:18
we need some way to get that heat out of
8:20
your system and bring cool air in
8:23
commonly this is done with fans we'll
8:26
often have fans right on top of our CPUs
8:28
to cool them directly we might also have
8:31
fans on our case that is pulling cool
8:33
air through the entire computer to not
8:35
only cool the CPU but everything else
8:38
inside of that case most motherboards
8:41
have temperature sensors and integrated
8:43
fan controllers on the motherboard
8:45
itself and those fan controllers are
8:47
configured inside of your system BIOS
8:50
this allows your motherboard to
8:52
constantly monitor the temperatures and
8:54
if it starts getting warm it can spin
8:56
those fans up a little bit faster to
8:58
help cool off the entire system you'll
9:01
notice on most modern motherboards that
9:03
your fans are connecting directly to the
9:05
motherboard itself so that it can
9:07
provide that cooling function you'll
9:09
notice this one is plugged in it's even
9:11
marked CPU fan one in our BIOS the fan
9:15
controls are located under the power
9:18
option and it's down under intelligent
9:20
cooling this computer supports a number
9:22
of different cooling options one is a
9:25
best performance which means it will run
9:27
at the best possible cooling for that
9:29
system a best experience which means it
9:32
will minimize the amount of noise being
9:34
made by the fans and then a full speed
9:36
where all fans in the system are always
9:39
running at full speed if your fan is
9:42
running in a place that's relatively
9:43
quiet you may want to use best
9:45
experience but if you're in a data
9:47
center you might want to choose full
9:49
speed you can decide which option is
9:51
best for you by making that change
9:53
inside of your
9:54
BIOS most of us probably have some type
9:57
of anti virus or anti-malware that runs
10:00
inside of our operating system but we
10:02
also need to protect against malware
10:04
that could load into your system before
10:06
the operating system starts one way to
10:09
prevent any malware from starting up
10:10
before your operating system or even
10:13
overriding your BIOS itself is to use a
10:16
feature known as secure boot this is a
10:19
new feature that was added with the UEFI
10:21
specification and you won't find this
10:23
inside of a legacy BIOS system secure
10:26
Boot has a digital signature for every
10:29
well-known operating system that you
10:31
might use this means that it knows what
10:34
the operating system should look like
10:36
and if malware makes any modification to
10:38
that software it will stop the boot
10:40
process and prevent that malware from
10:42
running so if you're trying to run a
10:44
very old operating system on your
10:46
computer you may find that the secure
10:48
boot feature doesn't allow that
10:49
operating system to run because it
10:52
doesn't have a digital signature for
10:54
that particular software in that case
10:56
you may need to disable secure boot so
10:59
that you can start up that older
11:01
software when you want to run the newer
11:03
software you'll want to reenable secure
11:06
boot so that it will work properly with
11:08
the modern operating system
11:10
secure boot checks not only the
11:13
operating system that you're running but
11:14
the BIOS itself when you start your
11:17
computer the secure boot process looks
11:19
at the BIOS configuration and determines
11:22
what the manufacturer's public key is
11:24
for that particular system secure boot
11:27
is not only protecting the operating
11:28
system that you're running it also
11:30
protects anyone from overriding your
11:32
BIOS it does this by checking the public
11:35
key for the manufacturer of your system
11:38
and it compares that with a digital
11:40
signature on the BIOS update that you're
11:42
trying to install if it notices that the
11:45
digital signature cannot be confirmed
11:47
with the public key it will prevent any
11:49
BIOS update from overriding the current
11:53
configuration secure boot also checks
11:55
the boot loader that runs before your
11:58
operating system starts it does this by
12:00
looking at the digital signature
12:02
associated with the bootloadader and
12:04
compares that to a trusted certificate
12:06
on your system if secure boot cannot
12:09
confirm that your digital signature is
12:11
valid it will not start the operating
12:13
system on our computer the secure boot
12:16
options are under security we'll have to
12:19
scroll down to find the secure boot
12:20
options and then we'll choose the option
12:23
for secure boot inside of this
12:25
configuration are options to enable or
12:27
disable secure boot and then to manage
12:30
the keys that are used to confirm those
12:32
digital
12:34
signatures there are also a number of
12:36
security features inside the BIOS that
12:38
can either prevent the system from
12:39
booting or prevent the system
12:41
configuration from being changed this is
12:44
all done through password management in
12:46
the BIOS itself if you'd like to prevent
12:48
anyone from booting this system unless
12:50
they have the right password then you'll
12:52
want to enable a boot password you'll
12:55
sometimes see this referred to as a user
12:57
password when your system starts up it
13:00
will prompt you for a password and you
13:02
must enter the password for that system
13:04
to boot an operating system this
13:06
obviously will work regardless of what
13:08
operating system you happen to be
13:10
running on that computer as a system
13:12
administrator you may want to make
13:14
configuration changes to your system and
13:16
prevent anyone from undoing those
13:19
changes that you've made a good example
13:21
of this is you may have disabled the USB
13:23
connections on your computer for
13:25
security reasons and you don't want
13:27
someone to change that configuration and
13:29
reenable those USB connections to be
13:32
able to prevent this change we would
13:34
configure a supervisor password you
13:36
might also see this referred to as a
13:39
BIOS password this restricts anyone from
13:42
starting the BIOS configuration unless
13:44
they have the correct password both of
13:47
these passwords are obviously important
13:49
to remember if you don't have the boot
13:51
password you can't start the computer
13:53
and if you don't have the supervisor
13:54
password you can't make any changes to
13:56
the BIOS if you do find yourself without
13:58
one of these passwords then you'll need
14:00
to reset the BIOS configuration
14:02
completely you'll want to check your
14:04
motherboard manufacturer to determine
14:06
what process is used to reset the BIOS
14:09
for your
14:10
system in our BIOS those passwords are
14:13
set in the security settings we were
14:15
already in the security settings when we
14:17
were looking at the secure boot options
14:19
so we'll back out of this and if we
14:21
scroll all the way to the top you can
14:22
see there are options for a supervisor
14:24
password a power on password and this
14:27
system also supports other passwords as
14:30
well our BIOS software and the BIOS
14:33
configuration settings are both stored
14:36
on the motherboard the BIOS software
14:38
itself what we sometimes refer to as the
14:40
firmware is stored in flash memory that
14:43
is on the motherboard and it's flash
14:45
memory so that we can upgrade that BIOS
14:47
if we need to the BIOS configuration
14:50
settings are often stored in separate
14:52
flash memory that is also on the
14:54
motherboard when working with the BIOS
14:56
you may run across references to CMOS
15:00
this is a complimentary metal oxide
15:02
semiconductor this is a type of memory
15:05
that we used to use when we were working
15:07
with the BIOS but these days most BIOS
15:10
configurations are simply flash memory
15:12
before the advent of flash memory most
15:15
of these configurations were stored in
15:17
volatile memory on the motherboard
15:19
itself and all of those configurations
15:21
were kept active with a battery that is
15:24
on the motherboard these days those BIOS
15:26
configurations are stored in nonvolatile
15:29
flash memory on the motherboard so they
15:31
don't need a battery backup or any type
15:33
of power source to maintain that
15:36
configuration for that reason if you
15:38
need to reset the BIOS configuration
15:40
simply removing the battery is not going
15:42
to do it you very commonly use a reset
15:44
process that needs physical access to
15:47
the motherboard you add a jumper to the
15:49
motherboard turn the computer back on
15:51
and it resets the BIOS
15:54
for example we have an ASUS motherboard
15:56
here this is a microATX motherboard and
15:59
if you look very closely near the bottom
16:01
of this motherboard you'll see a small
16:03
chip that's the BIOS chip that is used
16:05
to store the BIOS firmware this
16:08
motherboard allows you to reset the BIOS
16:10
configuration using a jumper that's
16:12
located just to the right of the BIOS
16:14
chip itself and you'll notice that it's
16:16
marked
16:17
CLRTC on this motherboard that stands
16:20
for clear realtime clock RAM we want to
16:24
use a jumper on those two pins to be
16:26
able to short that connection and turn
16:29
the computer on to reset the BIOS config
16:33
this is what the pins look like on the
16:34
motherboard you can see it's just a
16:36
couple of copper pins sticking out of
16:38
the motherboard and we want to connect
16:40
those pins together to do that we use a
16:42
jumper it is one of these little plastic
16:45
squares and inside of this plastic
16:47
square is a piece of metal that connects
16:49
those two copper connections together if
16:52
you look closely at this image you can
16:54
see the bar going straight across and if
16:56
you push this jumper down onto those two
16:58
pins it connects those two copper pins
17:00
together and you've shorted the
17:02
connection there are a remarkable number
17:05
of temperature sensors on your
17:06
motherboard you'll have sensors inside
17:08
of your CPU inside of the memory and
17:11
inside of other components that are on
17:12
the motherboard itself for that reason
17:15
most BIOS configurations have an option
17:17
for temperature monitoring so you can
17:19
start up the BIOS software to see what
17:21
temperatures this system might be seeing
17:24
you can certainly use thirdparty
17:25
software to be able to view these
17:27
temperatures but most BIOS software will
17:30
also allow you to view that temperature
17:31
information within the BIOS
17:33
configuration itself this allows you to
17:35
monitor the temperature inside the
17:37
hardware of the computer itself without
17:39
bringing in any other operating systems
17:41
or other thirdparty
17:43
software these temperature settings may
17:46
be in a central monitoring tool or it
17:48
may be added to the hardware monitoring
17:50
that you have on the system for example
17:53
on this computer the CPU itself is
17:55
currently showing a 45° centigrade
17:58
temperature so if you've installed some
18:00
new hardware and you want to be sure the
18:01
system is cooling everything properly
18:04
you may want to look inside of your BIOS
18:06
first before starting the operating
18:09
system these days we tend to use
18:11
virtualization for many different uses
18:14
and there is hardware inside of your
18:16
computer that can enhance the overall
18:18
process of virtualization this is
18:21
enabled and disabled inside of the BIOS
18:24
of your system most of this
18:26
virtualization hardware is built into
18:28
the CPU inside of your computer so
18:30
you'll need to check the manufacturer
18:32
specification to see what options might
18:35
be available for your particular central
18:37
processing unit by enabling these
18:39
virtualization capabilities and hardware
18:41
we can make the process more stable and
18:44
much faster if you're using an Intel CPU
18:47
on your motherboard you want to look to
18:48
see if you can enable the Intel
18:50
virtualization technology or VT if this
18:54
is an AMD motherboard then you'll want
18:56
to enable AMD virtualization or
18:59
AMDV in our BIOS we'll find all of those
19:03
virtualization options under the
19:04
advanced option and we'll choose the CPU
19:07
setup feature and the first option at
19:10
the top is AMD secure virtual machine
19:13
and we can enable or disable that from
19:15
inside of our UE5 BIOS

a lot of what we do in technology has to
0:04
do with secrets we have a lot of
0:06
information that we want to keep secret
0:08
from other people and in some cases we
0:11
want to be sure that the information
0:12
we're storing on our own system is only
0:15
available to us and no one else to
0:18
provide this security we need to use
0:20
encryption and we use encryption on
0:22
almost everything your mobile phone is
0:25
using encryption not only to store
0:27
information but to transmit information
0:29
over the airwaves when we send
0:31
information back and forth to a web
0:33
server that entire network communication
0:35
is encrypted and when we're storing
0:37
information on our local hard drive or
0:39
SSD all of that data can also be
0:42
encrypted very often the process that we
0:45
use for encrypting and decrypting data
0:47
is a very well-known process these are
0:50
usually based on standards that are open
0:52
and public and you can reference and
0:54
read through those standards to
0:56
understand exactly what's happening when
0:58
information is encrypted and decrypted
1:01
this is very common to the doorork knobs
1:03
that we use connected to our house but
1:05
just knowing how a lock in a door knob
1:08
works doesn't somehow allow you access
1:11
through that door to be able to gain
1:13
access you need the one thing that is
1:15
unique that no one else has and that's
1:18
your key although we don't have a
1:20
physical door key on our computer we
1:22
have digital keys that we use during
1:25
this encryption and decryption process
1:27
and if we are encrypting data with a key
1:30
we need to be sure that we have the
1:31
correct key to be able to decrypt that
1:33
information later but now we have a
1:36
problem where we have data that we've
1:38
encrypted we need to protect the key
1:40
that we've encrypted it with but how do
1:43
you protect the key that you're using
1:45
for all of these cryptographic functions
1:47
on your personal computer one of the
1:49
ways that we can help protect this key
1:51
is by using a trusted platform module or
1:54
a TPM this TPM is a standardized piece
1:58
of hardware that is built for encryption
2:00
there are many different cryptographic
2:02
functions built into this piece of
2:04
hardware and in this image you can see
2:06
that the TPM is a module that was
2:08
installed onto the motherboard
2:10
separately your motherboard may have the
2:13
TPM built into the motherboard itself
2:16
this TPM includes a cryptographic
2:18
processor so we can have random number
2:20
generation occur on this TPM we can also
2:23
generate cryptographic keys on this TPM
2:26
this TPM also includes persistent memory
2:29
which contains burnedin keys that were
2:31
created during the manufacturer of the
2:33
TPM there's also part of the TPM that
2:36
handles versatile memory so it can store
2:39
keys and other information within the
2:41
memory of the TPM and perhaps most
2:44
importantly the TPM is built for
2:46
security this is password protected and
2:48
has a number of security features that
2:50
prevent somebody from gaining access to
2:53
your very private cryptographic
2:55
keys this trusted platform module has a
2:59
cryptographic key that is secret to only
3:01
your system and it's unique to only your
3:03
system nobody else has the same key for
3:06
that reason your encryption keys are now
3:09
associated with your individual computer
3:12
and we can use those keys to perform
3:14
different functions for example if
3:16
you've enabled Bit Locker or some other
3:18
type of full disk encryption on your
3:19
computer you can use these keys to be
3:22
able to provide the encryption necessary
3:25
to protect the data that you're storing
3:26
on that device this also means that you
3:29
can't take the storage device out of
3:31
your computer and then move it to
3:33
another computer to gain access to the
3:34
data you would still need to decrypt the
3:37
data and the decryption key is back on
3:39
the original computer inside of the TPM
3:42
since this TPM contains this unique key
3:45
and it's tied to this piece of hardware
3:48
we can associate the hardware with the
3:50
TPM we refer to this as a root of trust
3:53
we know that that TPM is unique to that
3:56
system and for that reason we can use
3:58
the TPM to make sure that the computer
4:00
that we're referencing across the
4:02
network really is the device that we're
4:04
expecting this TPM can also be used to
4:07
remotely determine if anything has
4:09
changed with that computer that way you
4:11
know if you're connecting to a system
4:13
across the network that that system
4:15
really is the one that you're expecting
4:17
to find and since the TPM is physically
4:20
part of the hardware of the system it's
4:23
not something that can easily be copied
4:25
off and moved to another computer you
4:28
know that when you're looking at that
4:29
TPM that you really are looking at that
4:32
particular physical
4:33
computer the BIOS of your computer
4:36
allows you to enable or disable
4:38
different features of your TPM on this
4:41
BIOS you'll find it under security and
4:43
under security if we scroll down you'll
4:45
see an option for TCG this stands for
4:48
trusted computing group which is the
4:50
organization that manages the standards
4:53
for TPM on this computer you see that we
4:56
have a TPM security chip 2.0 and you're
4:58
able to enable or disable the TPM
5:00
functionality from inside the BIOS you
5:03
can also clear any data that may be
5:04
stored in the TPM from this setting and
5:07
you can configure different parameters
5:08
on how that information is
5:11
deleted well the TPM is a good choice
5:14
for managing security on a single device
5:17
but in many of our data centers we might
5:19
have hundreds or thousands of devices
5:21
and every single one of those devices
5:23
has some type of security key associated
5:26
with it in these types of environments
5:28
we need some type of largecale security
5:31
solution to manage and maintain these
5:33
keys and that solution is a hardware
5:35
security module or HSM hsms are often
5:39
used to centralize the backup of all of
5:42
these keys across all of your systems so
5:45
if you wanted to have all of your web
5:47
server keys stored on one central
5:49
protected device you would install an
5:51
HSM and have that device manage all of
5:54
those keys there are also lightweight or
5:56
personal HSM that you could use to store
5:59
personal keys on a device that could
6:01
then be moved from one computer to
6:03
another this is a type of lightweight
6:05
HSM used for protecting cryptocurrency
6:08
where you can store this information and
6:10
protect it on this mobile HSM in a data
6:14
center however we're usually configuring
6:16
a high-end server and configuring it
6:18
with cryptographic hardware to serve as
6:20
our HSM in many cases this device is not
6:23
only storing keys but it's also
6:25
accelerating the cryptographic functions
6:27
between one device and another so for
6:29
example instead of your web server
6:31
performing any type of cryptographic
6:33
encryption and decryption you can have
6:35
that entire process take place in
6:37
hardware on an HSM and offload that from
6:41
any of your softwarebased
6:43
services so if we had to compare a TPM
6:46
with an HSM we could say that a trusted
6:49
platform module is generally used on a
6:52
single system you're securing data on
6:54
that local device it's often built into
6:56
the motherboard or you could install it
6:58
as a separate physical module and if you
7:01
are working with a mobile phone that's
7:02
booting there's a screen lock process or
7:05
there's some type of full disk
7:06
encryption you're probably using
7:09
ATPM hsm or hardware security modules
7:12
tend to be used by many systems and
7:14
we're usually storing information across
7:16
multiple devices onto that secure
7:19
storage of the HSM these are often
7:21
deployed in a data center as a high-end
7:23
device usually with cryptographic
7:25
hardware and they're usually deployed to
7:27
protect those important keys that you
7:29
have in your infrastructure such as the
7:31
keys you might have to protect the
7:32
encryption of your web servers or those
7:34
for your certificate authority

if you look at the system information
0:03
for your computer you'll see a lot of
0:05
interesting information for example on
0:08
this computer the system type is a
0:10
64-bit operating system and it is an
0:13
ARMbased processor and you may be
0:15
wondering what do those specifications
0:17
refer to well let's start with the
0:19
64-bit operating system in today's
0:22
modern world we tend to see two
0:24
different kinds of operating systems a
0:27
32-bit and a 64-bit this is referring to
0:30
the capabilities of the CPU on your
0:33
computer and how much information is
0:36
able to process at any particular time
0:39
it also refers to the total amount of
0:41
address space that a single CPU could
0:43
reference for example a 32-bit processor
0:46
can store ones and zeros to a maximum of
0:50
2 to the 32nd power and that is a lot of
0:53
information that we are storing into the
0:55
memory of a system but with today's
0:57
technologies a 32-bit address size is
1:00
relatively small that's why we created a
1:02
64-bit processor which can store 2 to
1:06
the 64th power of total information and
1:09
you can see that very large value is
1:12
listed on the screen if we want to put
1:14
this in a bit more of accessible terms
1:17
you can specify a 32-bit processor can
1:20
reference 4 GB of memory where a 64-bit
1:24
processor can reference 17 billion GB of
1:28
memory now obviously the 64-bit
1:31
operating system that I'm using on my
1:33
computer probably can't reference 17
1:36
billion GB and my computer probably
1:39
couldn't support that much memory inside
1:41
of a system but many operating systems
1:44
can scale up to very large amounts and
1:47
they're able to do that because they're
1:49
running a 64-bit
1:51
processor as you can imagine there are a
1:53
number of differences in operation
1:55
between a 32-bit operating system and a
1:58
64-bit operating system for example if
2:01
you're running a 64-bit OS your hardware
2:04
drivers that you're using on that
2:05
operating system need to be written for
2:07
a 64-bit operating system if you're
2:10
using a 32-bit operating system then you
2:12
need to make sure your hardware drivers
2:14
are written for a 32-bit OS in the world
2:17
of Intel processors you'll often see the
2:19
32-bit processors referenced as an x86
2:23
processor that's a reference back to the
2:25
older 8086 style CPU and you'll see
2:28
64-bit processors referenced as x64 the
2:32
applications that run on these different
2:34
operating systems are also different for
2:37
example a 32-bit operating system cannot
2:40
run applications that were made for a
2:42
64-bit operating system the reverse
2:45
however is usually true a 64-bit
2:47
operating system usually can run 32-bit
2:50
applications if you were to look at your
2:52
Windows operating system you'll notice
2:54
that the program files folder has
2:57
different areas depending on the type of
2:59
applications that you're installing for
3:01
example all of your 32-bit applications
3:03
are being installed in program files x86
3:06
and your 64-bit applications are simply
3:09
stored in program
3:11
files there's another CPU architecture
3:14
that has become very popular in our
3:16
modern world and it's an architecture
3:18
created by ARM limited this architecture
3:20
is named advanced risk machine which is
3:23
also abbreviated with the word ARM this
3:26
is the company that creates the
3:28
specification for the chip and they
3:30
license that specification to third
3:32
parties arm processors tend to be very
3:35
very efficient they use less power less
3:38
heat and they're very fast at processing
3:40
information this is why we see that 99%
3:44
of the mobile phones that we are using
3:46
these days have ARM processors and we're
3:48
starting to see more and more desktop
3:50
and laptop computers use ARM as the
3:53
primary processor inside of their
3:55
devices as
3:57
well we often refer to these processors
4:00
from Intel and AMD and ARM as CPUs
4:04
individual single devices but inside of
4:07
that single CPU package are a number of
4:10
individual processors referred to as
4:12
processor cores you'll often see a
4:14
processor referred to by the number of
4:17
cores inside of that processor it might
4:19
be an 8 core or 16 core processor and
4:22
inside of each one of these cores you
4:25
will often find an individual CPU and
4:27
cache memory that is specific to that
4:30
core this means multiple cores can
4:32
perform multiple instructions
4:34
simultaneously thereby increasing the
4:36
overall efficiency of that computing
4:39
process if you were to look at a
4:42
magnified view of a CPU die you can
4:44
almost make out the individual cores
4:47
this is a rendering of what appears to
4:49
be a 16 core CPU you can almost make out
4:52
the individual CPUs for each core inside
4:55
of this chip and you can see where the
4:57
cache memory is located for each of the
5:00
cores inside of this CPU

our modern computers are designed to be
0:04
modular We have ways to extend the
0:06
functionality of our computer by adding
0:09
additional hardware onto the motherboard
0:11
itself We're able to do this through the
0:13
use of expansion cards These are cards
0:16
that provide additional functionality
0:18
that's not already available on the
0:20
motherboard itself So we can get a
0:22
generic motherboard and then customize
0:24
it to do exactly what we need it to do
0:27
We've designed these expansion cards to
0:29
be installable by the end user So you
0:31
don't have to take your computer back to
0:33
the manufacturer to have these installed
0:35
You can open up the top of your computer
0:37
and install the card yourself And the
0:40
process is relatively simple You can
0:42
install the hardware in your computer
0:44
turn it on and most of the time your
0:46
operating system will automatically
0:48
identify the card install the proper
0:50
device drivers that you need and you're
0:52
immediately able to use your new
0:54
hardware
0:56
A good example of an expansion card you
0:58
might add to your system is one for
1:00
audio This is a sound card and it can
1:02
provide audio output that is far
1:05
superior to what you might have on your
1:07
motherboard This might include
1:08
specialized hardware to give you higher
1:11
quality audio or it may have additional
1:13
output functions that you can plug in a
1:15
home theater with multiple speakers and
1:18
a subwoofer These audio cards might also
1:21
provide input So you might want to plug
1:23
in multiple audio sources from different
1:25
devices You might have musical
1:27
instruments you'd like to plug in or
1:29
there may be multiple
1:31
microphones Here's a sound card that
1:33
supports a number of different inputs
1:35
outputs and formats We have audio output
1:38
on left and right channels a headphone
1:41
input a line input and then a digital
1:44
audio output
1:46
The CPUs of many motherboards support an
1:49
integrated graphics function that is
1:51
built into the CPU itself But if you're
1:53
doing some type of high-end graphics
1:55
processing video editing or gaming you
1:58
may want a discrete graphics adapter
2:01
This is a graphics processing unit that
2:03
is external to your central processing
2:06
unit This separate graphics card
2:08
provides additional CPU power and memory
2:11
so that you can perform the highestend
2:13
graphics functions on your system The
2:16
connectors associated with the
2:18
integrated graphics inside of a CPU can
2:20
often be found directly connected to the
2:22
motherboard We can see some of those
2:24
here There's a VGA DVI and an HDMI
2:28
interface and they are all connected
2:30
directly to this motherboard A separate
2:32
discrete graphics card or GPU has a
2:35
connection that fits directly in the
2:37
motherboard and it has its own video
2:40
output on the card
2:42
itself A discrete graphics card is
2:45
usually designed for outputting video
2:48
but often you might want to have video
2:50
input into your computer and you can do
2:52
that using a capture card This might
2:55
come from a separate video source such
2:57
as a camera or you may be connecting
2:59
separate computers as video input into
3:02
your computer When you're dealing with
3:04
video there is a lot of data that is
3:06
being transferred So most of these
3:08
capture cards will have very high
3:10
throughputs and they're usually
3:11
connected directly to the PCI Express
3:14
bus Here's an example of a video capture
3:17
card This one supports video input over
3:19
HDMI and SDI which is a serialized form
3:23
of video input and it connects directly
3:25
to the PCI Express
3:28
bus Although we'll often connect the
3:30
networks wirelessly there may be an
3:32
occasion where you want to physically
3:34
connect to a wired Ethernet connection
3:37
And some motherboards may not have an
3:39
Ethernet jack built into the motherboard
3:41
itself or perhaps the Ethernet
3:43
connection on your motherboard is no
3:44
longer operating If either of those
3:46
happens to be the case you may want to
3:48
install a separate network interface
3:50
card You might also want to install one
3:52
of these nicks if you're installing a
3:54
server some type of security device or
3:57
anything else that needs multiple
3:59
Ethernet
4:00
connections And of course the process
4:02
for installing a network interface card
4:04
is exactly the same as any other adapter
4:06
card Once you find an open slot on your
4:09
motherboard you can install the card and
4:11
then restart your system and install the
4:13
proper hardware drivers
4:15
If you're installing into a server you
4:17
might need a card that supports multiple
4:19
Ethernet connections and you can do that
4:21
by installing a multiport Ethernet card
4:24
This multiport card supports four
4:26
separate Ethernet connections in one
4:28
slot of your
4:29
motherboard When you're trying to find
4:32
the right adapter card you may want to
4:34
check a number of different sources to
4:36
find the one that's right for you For
4:38
example you might want to start with
4:39
your motherboard documentation to
4:41
confirm that you have the right number
4:43
and type of interfaces Then you'll want
4:45
to check with the manufacturer of the
4:47
adapter card to see what the minimum
4:49
hardware and software requirements are
4:51
to use that particular hardware You
4:53
might also want to look into the
4:54
knowledge base from the manufacturer to
4:56
see if there might be things that you
4:58
haven't thought of yet And of course you
5:00
could ask others who are using this
5:01
adapter what they've seen with this
5:03
hardware Some hardware requires you to
5:06
install a driver before you install the
5:09
hardware and other adapter cards require
5:12
you install the driver after you install
5:14
the hardware Make sure you check the
5:16
documentation for your adapter card to
5:18
see what the proper process is for that
5:21
hardware In many cases you'll find that
5:23
the device driver is installed
5:25
automatically once you install the
5:27
hardware but you'll want to confirm that
5:29
with the documentation prior to starting
5:31
up your system You then might want to
5:33
check the manufacturer's website and
5:35
make sure that you're using the latest
5:37
version of device drivers If you're
5:39
using a previous version you may need to
5:41
manually uninstall that device driver
5:44
before installing the newer version
5:46
Sometimes this is done through the
5:47
Windows frontend and other times the
5:49
manufacturer has their own process for
5:51
installing the device driver You can use
5:54
Windows device manager to both install
5:56
the driver and check the status of the
5:58
driver Once the system is booted you'll
6:00
then be able to see the device driver
6:02
details and see if the driver is working
6:04
properly with your new hardware

all of the technology inside of our
0:04
computers creates heat one of the best
0:06
ways to cool off the inside is to pull
0:09
cool air through the system using fans
0:12
it's very common to pull cool air into
0:14
one side of a case have that cool air
0:17
pass over the much warmer components
0:20
inside which of course heats up the air
0:22
and the hot air is expelled out the
0:24
other side of the case the layout of
0:27
devices on the motherboard and the other
0:29
components inside the case all
0:31
contribute to how well the air can flow
0:34
through this particular case you want to
0:36
be sure to make sure all of your wires
0:38
and other components are out of the way
0:40
and that you have a good air flow to
0:42
pass from one side of the case to the
0:43
other there are many different types of
0:46
cases many different types of cooling
0:48
systems and all of these work together
0:51
to provide you with an optimal form of
0:53
cooling
0:55
if you look at the different adapter
0:56
cards inside of your computer you may
0:58
find that the cards themselves have
1:00
their own fans this takes the cool air
1:03
inside of your computer and directs it
1:05
to a single point on this particular
1:07
adapter card it's very likely that the
1:10
components of this particular kind of
1:11
adapter card get very warm and need this
1:14
additional cooling of an onboard fan of
1:17
course to support this onboard fan we
1:19
need enough room so you may find these
1:21
fans are only used on larger adapter
1:24
cards very often you'll find these types
1:26
of fans on high-end video cards or
1:28
graphics cards the fans that are
1:31
installed onto the case of your computer
1:33
come in very standard sizes and you'll
1:35
often find 80 mm 120 mm or 200 mm sized
1:40
fans these fans are often variable speed
1:43
so they'll run at slower speeds while
1:45
your computer is cool and then run
1:47
faster and faster as your computer heats
1:50
up this means that as the fans go faster
1:53
the noise gets a bit louder and you can
1:55
find different types of fans from
1:57
different manufacturers that have
1:58
different amounts of audio output this
2:01
is important especially if you're an
2:02
environment like I am where you want to
2:04
be sure that everything is as quiet as
2:06
possible
2:08
one of the best ways to avoid any fan
2:10
noise is to avoid the fan completely to
2:13
be able to cool these systems we use a
2:16
fanless system or what we call passive
2:18
cooling you'll often see passive cooling
2:20
used in areas where you'd like the
2:22
system to remain quiet things like a
2:24
video server or a set top box on top of
2:27
your television are perfect places to
2:29
have passive cooling you often see this
2:31
type of passive cooling used on
2:33
purpose-built appliances and devices
2:35
where the amount of heat can be easily
2:38
managed and this is very often used in
2:40
conjunction with a heat sink to be able
2:42
to take all of the heat from an
2:44
individual component and spread that
2:46
heat out over a much larger
2:48
area heat sinks are critical for
2:51
dissipating heat inside of your computer
2:53
and it's very possible you have many
2:55
different types of heat sink in the
2:57
system that you're using right now these
2:59
work by taking the heat that's on a
3:01
component and spreading that heat across
3:03
many individual fins effectively
3:06
increasing the surface area for cooling
3:09
as the air passes through these fins it
3:11
transfers the heat from the fins to the
3:13
air and begins the cooling process all
3:16
over again if you're working inside of a
3:18
computer that has a heat sink be very
3:21
careful about touching them they get
3:22
very hot it's very easy to burn yourself
3:25
if the system has been running for any
3:27
amount of time you also want to make
3:29
sure that you have the proper amount of
3:30
thermal paste so that you have a good
3:32
thermal connection between the very hot
3:34
component and the heat sink itself you
3:38
might also hear thermal paste referred
3:39
to as thermal grease or conductive
3:42
grease this is an adhesive you put on
3:44
top of the hot component so that you can
3:46
fasten the heat sink to the top this
3:48
also creates this thermal connection
3:50
between the hot component and the heat
3:52
sink and since you're usually placing
3:54
the heat sink directly on top of the
3:56
component it usually doesn't take much
3:59
thermal paste to be able to make a good
4:01
connection usually it's a p-sized
4:03
component and that's all you'll need so
4:06
that it flattens out and distributes
4:07
itself evenly over the hot
4:10
component another good form to create a
4:12
thermal connection is to use a thermal
4:15
pad this is the pad that you see here
4:17
that you would put right on top of the
4:19
hot CPU or the hot component and you
4:21
would place a heat sink on top of the
4:23
thermal pad you would usually use a
4:26
thermal pad when you were concerned
4:27
about thermal paste perhaps leaking out
4:29
and damaging other components the
4:31
thermal pad is not quite as effective as
4:34
thermal paste but it still makes a very
4:36
good connection between the hot part of
4:38
your computer and the heat sink and like
4:40
thermal paste the thermal pad is not
4:42
reusable so if you do remove it you'll
4:44
need to replace it with a new one when
4:46
you put on the new heat sink these are
4:49
certainly less messy to install than
4:51
thermal paste and you would usually put
4:53
the heat sink right on top of the
4:55
thermal pad and if this is a CPU we
4:58
might have a CPU on the bottom we might
5:00
have thermal paste or a thermal pad on
5:02
top of the CPU we would then put a heat
5:05
sink on top of the thermal pad or
5:07
thermal paste and then on top of that we
5:09
might include a fan just to make sure
5:12
we're getting plenty of cooling all the
5:14
way down to the component and if you
5:16
need a larger fan you might want to put
5:18
it sideways so your CPU is still
5:20
underneath you would have a heat sink on
5:22
top of that CPU and then a much larger
5:25
fan that blows air through that entire
5:27
heat
5:28
sink well if your fans are making too
5:30
much noise or they're not providing
5:32
enough cooling you might want to
5:34
consider liquid cooling this is the same
5:36
type of cooling you might find in an
5:38
automobile or in mainframe computers
5:41
usually you would have liquid cooling on
5:43
high-end systems but we're finding that
5:45
liquid cooling is perfect for things
5:47
like a gaming computer you might have at
5:49
home you might also see this liquid
5:51
cooling used when someone is
5:52
overclocking their system to try to get
5:55
as much performance out of their
5:57
processor as possible this liquid
5:59
cooling system usually consists of the
6:01
heat sink that sits on top of the
6:03
processor there are pipes that take the
6:05
coolant over to a set of radiators that
6:08
often have fans blowing through them
6:10
once you place that transfer unit for
6:12
the heat on top of your CPU you can then
6:15
have all of the liquid transfer between
6:18
the CPU itself over to the radiator have
6:21
the air blow through to cool off the
6:22
coolant and then return the coolant back
6:24
to the CPU
