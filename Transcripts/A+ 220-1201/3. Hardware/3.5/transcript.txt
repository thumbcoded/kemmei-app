## Motherboard Types, CPUs, and Form Factors

When you look at different computing platforms, you’ll see large desktop computers and much smaller systems, like those used in small offices or as media center PCs. Both types have similar internal components: a CPU, memory, storage, network connections, and other parts. However, the physical size and layout of these platforms are very different. The desktop computer is much larger, while the media center or compact office computer is much smaller. The motherboard in a smaller system will not be the same form factor as in a desktop, so it’s important to understand the differences between motherboard types.

**Physical size** is a key consideration when selecting a motherboard. Larger motherboards offer more flexibility and can support more components, such as additional memory slots, expansion slots, and storage connectors. Smaller motherboards may have fewer features but are ideal for compact spaces. **Power connections** are mostly standardized, but not all motherboards use the exact same connectors, so you must check compatibility with your power supply. **Airflow and cooling** are also crucial, as all systems generate heat and require adequate cooling solutions.

There are over 40 different motherboard types, but for CompTIA A+ certification, you only need to focus on three: **ATX**, **microATX**, and **ITX** (specifically mini-ITX).

- **ATX (Advanced Technology Extended)** is the largest of the three and has been the standard since 1995. Early ATX boards used a 20-pin power connector, while modern ones use a 24-pin connector. ATX boards typically have multiple expansion slots (PCI, PCIe), four or more memory slots, and a centrally located CPU socket. Server motherboards, which are often based on ATX, may support multiple CPUs, more RAM slots, and additional expansion slots, and are designed for rack-mount cases.
- **MicroATX** is similar in layout to ATX but is smaller. It uses the same mounting points and power connectors as ATX, making it compatible with ATX cases. However, microATX boards usually have fewer expansion slots and memory slots, so you must prioritize which features are most important for your build.
- **Mini-ITX** is the smallest of the three and is designed for very compact systems. It also uses the same mounting points as ATX, so it can fit into an ATX or microATX case. Mini-ITX boards are ideal for small form factor builds, such as home theater PCs or single-purpose computers, but typically have only one expansion slot and two memory slots.

When choosing a motherboard, consider the intended use. For example, a media center PC may only need a mini-ITX board, while a gaming or video editing workstation may require a full-size ATX board for maximum expandability. Server motherboards may be required for enterprise environments where multiple CPUs and large amounts of RAM are needed.

When installing a CPU, it’s important to use the correct socket type for your motherboard (Intel and AMD use different sockets). No force should be required—just align the CPU and lock it in place. Some server motherboards support multiple CPU sockets.

## Buses, Expansion, Power, and Storage

A motherboard is like a small city, with various components connected by **buses**—pathways that allow data to travel between the CPU, memory, storage, and expansion slots. These buses are essential for the system to function as a unified whole and allow for the addition of expansion cards to increase functionality.

**Older motherboards** may have a **PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)** bus, introduced in 1994, available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. PCI uses parallel communication, sending multiple bits of data simultaneously across separate lines. The 32-bit PCI slot is shorter than the 64-bit version, and expansion cards are keyed to fit the correct slot.

**Modern motherboards** use **PCI Express (PCIe)**, which uses serial communication and is much faster and more scalable than PCI. PCIe slots are labeled by the number of lanes they support: x1, x4, x8, or x16. More lanes mean higher data throughput, which is especially important for graphics cards (usually x16). PCIe slots and cards are keyed differently from PCI, and PCIe cards may have a latch that must be released before removal. PCIe cards can be used for graphics, storage, networking, and other expansion needs.

**Installing an expansion card** involves aligning the card with the slot, pressing it in firmly but carefully, and securing it to the case with a screw. For PCIe cards, remember to release the latch before removing the card to avoid damaging the slot. Some expansion cards, such as graphics cards, require additional power connections.

**Motherboard power** is supplied through a large connector, providing 3.3V, 5V, and 12V DC. Older boards use a 20-pin connector, while newer ones use 24 pins. Some power supplies have modular connectors to support both. High-power expansion cards, such as graphics cards, may require additional power through PCIe 6-pin (75W) or 8-pin (150W) connectors. Some connectors are designed to be split, so an 8-pin can be used as a 6-pin if needed.

**Storage devices** connect to the motherboard using **SATA (Serial ATA)** interfaces, which have an L-shaped connector for data. Some motherboards also have **eSATA** ports for external drives. **M.2 connectors** are used for high-speed NVMe SSDs and are much smaller than SATA connectors. Installing an M.2 drive involves inserting it into the slot at an angle and fastening it down with a screw.

**Pin headers** are groups of pins on the motherboard used to connect case buttons (power, reset), LEDs, USB ports, audio jacks, and sometimes TPM modules. These headers are usually labeled on the motherboard, and the case cables must be connected to the correct pins for proper operation. Pin headers may also be used for Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), front panel connectors, and additional USB or audio ports.

**Expansion cards** such as sound cards, graphics cards, capture cards, and network interface cards can be added to extend system functionality. Some cards require driver installation before hardware installation; always check the documentation. Use Windows Device Manager to install, update, and troubleshoot drivers. Multiport network cards are available for servers needing multiple Ethernet connections.

## BIOS, Security, Virtualization, and Cooling

When you power on your computer, the **BIOS (Basic Input Output System)** or **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** firmware initializes the system and prepares it to load the operating system. The **POST (Power On Self-Test)** process checks for essential components like CPU, memory, keyboard, and mouse. If a problem is detected, you may see an error message or hear beep codes. Once POST is complete, the bootloader starts the operating system.

To access the BIOS/UEFI, press a specific key (often Delete, F1, F2, or a key combination) during system startup. On virtual machines, some hypervisors allow BIOS access, but not all (e.g., VirtualBox does not). Windows 10/11 uses fast startup, which may prevent BIOS access unless you do a full shutdown or restart with Shift held down. Always document and back up BIOS/UEFI changes, as incorrect settings can cause instability. Disabling hardware (like USB ports) in BIOS can enhance security. Modern BIOS settings are stored in flash memory, not CMOS, so removing the battery won’t reset them; use a motherboard jumper to reset.

**Legacy BIOS** is text-based and limited in hardware support. **UEFI** is the modern standard, offering a graphical interface, mouse support, and advanced features such as secure boot, large drive support, and network booting. UEFI settings allow you to configure CPU, storage, power management, security, and more. Always document any changes you make in the BIOS/UEFI, as incorrect settings can cause system instability.

**BIOS/UEFI settings** include configuring the boot order, enabling or disabling onboard devices, and managing security features. **Secure Boot** uses digital signatures to ensure only trusted software loads during startup. You can set passwords to restrict access to the BIOS/UEFI or to prevent unauthorized booting. BIOS/UEFI settings are stored in non-volatile flash memory, not in volatile CMOS, so removing the battery will not reset them; a physical jumper is usually required for a reset.

**Temperature sensors** on the motherboard monitor system temperatures, and **fan controllers** can be configured in the BIOS/UEFI to adjust fan speeds based on temperature readings. This helps maintain optimal cooling and system stability. Fans come in standard sizes (80mm, 120mm, 200mm) and may be variable speed to balance cooling and noise. Passive cooling (fanless) is used in quiet environments and appliances, often with heat sinks to dissipate heat. Heat sinks spread heat across fins for efficient cooling; always use thermal paste or pads for good thermal contact, and replace pads if removed. Liquid cooling is used in high-performance or overclocked systems, circulating coolant through a radiator and pump to remove heat from the CPU.

**Virtualization support** (such as Intel VT-x or AMD-V) can be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI to improve performance and compatibility for virtual machines.

**Security features** include hardware-based encryption and key management using a **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** or **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**. TPM is built into the motherboard or installed as a module and is used for functions like BitLocker drive encryption. TPM provides a root of trust, ensuring encryption keys are unique to your system and enabling features like BitLocker. TPM can also be used for remote attestation and device authentication. In data centers, Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) manage keys for many systems and can accelerate cryptographic operations. BIOS security includes supervisor (setup) and user (boot) passwords; if lost, you must reset the BIOS using the manufacturer’s process.

**CPUs** may be 32-bit or 64-bit, which affects the amount of memory they can address and the types of operating systems and applications they can run. 32-bit (x86) CPUs can address up to 4GB of RAM, while 64-bit (x64) CPUs can address much more. 64-bit operating systems can run most 32-bit applications, but not vice versa. **ARM processors** are common in mobile devices due to their power efficiency and are increasingly used in desktops and laptops. Modern CPUs often have multiple cores, allowing them to process multiple instructions simultaneously for better performance. Each core may have its own cache, and multi-core CPUs can improve multitasking and overall system speed.
