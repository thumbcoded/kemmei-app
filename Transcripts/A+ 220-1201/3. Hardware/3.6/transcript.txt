before we get into this presentation on
0:04
power I want to give you a very strong
0:06
warning to always always disconnect from
0:10
any power source if you're ever going to
0:12
work on the inside of any computer not
0:16
only is there a concern about
0:17
electrocution from that direct power
0:19
source but there may be components
0:21
within your computer that are storing
0:23
power in capacitors you have to be sure
0:26
that you know exactly what you're
0:28
touching inside of that computer and you
0:30
have to be knowledgeable enough to know
0:32
how to discharge those capacitors before
0:34
you work with that equipment another
0:36
common mistake that I see people make is
0:39
connecting themselves to the electrical
0:41
system of the building you never want to
0:44
connect yourself or anyone to any part
0:47
of a building's electrical system even
0:50
if it's the ground wire the ground wire
0:52
of a building could be energized at any
0:54
time so you want to be sure that you do
0:56
not connect yourself to any part of that
0:59
system our goal when working with this
1:02
type of equipment that uses electricity
1:04
is to always have a healthy respect for
1:07
anything dealing with power and if you
1:09
have a system that you're going to be
1:11
working with you should always double
1:12
check and make sure that you have
1:14
disconnected yourself from the main
1:16
power source
1:18
if you look inside of a desktop computer
1:20
you will find a relatively large power
1:23
supply this power supply is providing
1:26
your computer with DC power or direct
1:29
current that's because your motherboard
1:31
and all of the components on your
1:33
motherboard need DC power to operate but
1:36
the type of power that we get from our
1:38
wall outlet is AC power or alternating
1:41
current that's why we need to convert
1:44
from AC to the DC that your motherboard
1:47
will use and this power supply is the
1:49
device that provides that conversion
1:52
these power supplies are designed to
1:53
convert 120 volts of AC or 240 volts of
1:58
AC to DC power specifically separate DC
2:02
voltages of 3.3 volt 5 vol and 12 V this
2:07
is probably one of the most important
2:09
components in your system because
2:11
everything inside your computer relies
2:13
on the power that's being provided by
2:15
this power
2:16
supply you'll see many different terms
2:19
associated with power inside of a
2:21
computer one of those terms is an ampear
2:24
you may see this abbreviated as an amp
2:26
or abbreviated as a capital A this
2:29
describes the number of electrons that
2:31
are moving past a single point in 1
2:33
second often we'll compare electricity
2:36
flowing through a wire to water that is
2:38
flowing through a hose you can think of
2:40
amps as that total amount of water
2:43
flowing through the hose so if you can
2:44
increase the size of the diameter of
2:46
that hose you can increase the number of
2:49
amps another term you'll see used is
2:52
voltage it's often abbreviated as volt
2:54
or the capital letter V you can think of
2:57
this as the pressure of electricity on a
3:00
particular wire and in the case of a
3:02
hose it would be the pressure of water
3:04
that's flowing through that hose if you
3:06
want to increase the amount of voltage
3:08
then you need to increase that pressure
3:10
very similar to increasing the amount of
3:12
water that might pass through a hose if
3:14
you know the voltage and you know the
3:16
number of amps you can calculate the
3:18
wattage this is often described as a
3:20
watt or a capital W and we think of this
3:23
as a measurement of real power use this
3:26
is a relatively easy calculation we
3:28
simply take the number of volts we
3:30
multiply that by the number of amps and
3:32
the resulting value is the total number
3:35
of watts so if you're working inside the
3:37
United States with 120 volts and the
3:40
device is using half of an amp then the
3:42
total amount of real power use would be
3:45
60 W if you look at the details of a
3:49
power supply you'll see specifications
3:51
for AC power and specifications for DC
3:54
power as we've mentioned earlier AC is
3:57
alternating current and it is referring
3:59
to current that is constantly reversing
4:02
direction you'll often see this shown as
4:04
a wave or a curvy line to designate
4:07
alternating current so alternating
4:09
current is what we use to get power from
4:12
our power plants to the outlets that are
4:14
in our homes and in our businesses we
4:17
often describe this alternating current
4:19
as the number of volts and how much this
4:21
is alternating in a single second and
4:24
that is referenced in hertz in the
4:27
United States and Canada we have 110 to
4:29
120 volts of alternating current you'll
4:32
sometimes see this abbreviated as VAC
4:35
for volts of AC and that is running at a
4:38
60 hertz rate hertz is often abbreviated
4:40
with an HZ if you're in Europe you're
4:43
probably running 220 to 240 volts of
4:46
alternating current and it runs at a
4:48
rate of 50 Hz our alternating current is
4:51
the input to our power supply and of
4:54
course our power supply is outputting
4:56
direct current or DC you'll often see DC
5:00
shown with the graphic of a single line
5:02
and multiple lines underneath direct
5:05
current as the name implies is power
5:07
that is moving in a single direction
5:09
with a constant
5:11
voltage so the power source that we're
5:13
connecting our computers to will be
5:15
different depending on where you are in
5:17
the world as we mentioned in the US and
5:19
Canada we'll see 120 volts of AC running
5:22
at 60 Hz in Europe is 230 volts at 50 Hz
5:26
that means that if we are moving a
5:28
computer from one place to the other we
5:31
need to be sure that we are connecting a
5:33
power supply that can use the type of
5:35
input that is used in that country if
5:38
you were to look at the back of a
5:39
relatively old power supply you might
5:41
even see a manual switch in the back
5:43
where you tell the power supply what
5:46
you're connecting to and that switch is
5:48
usually marked with 120 volts and 230
5:51
volts if you're not sure what type of
5:54
power is coming out of the outlet that
5:56
you're connecting to you might want to
5:57
grab a multimeter and test that outlet
6:00
to see what type of alternating current
6:02
is on the other side if you look at the
6:05
back of your computer you might notice
6:07
that it doesn't have a switch to
6:08
manually move between 120 volts and 230
6:12
volts that's because most modern power
6:14
supplies will recognize the type of
6:17
power they're connecting to and will
6:19
adjust accordingly to work properly
6:21
regardless of where you happen to be in
6:23
the world if you do have one of these
6:25
manual power supplies you want to be
6:27
very careful of how you're configuring
6:29
that switch on the back you don't want
6:31
to take a power supply that is currently
6:33
set for 120 volts and plug it in to a
6:36
230 volt power source if you plug in a
6:39
power supply with those settings then
6:41
you'll probably quickly find the power
6:43
supply will be overloaded and it will
6:45
most likely be a spectacular failure
6:48
here's a better view of this manual
6:51
switch on the back of one of these older
6:53
power supplies if you are planning to
6:55
connect this device for the first time
6:56
you may want to reference that settings
6:58
to see what it's configured for on that
7:00
power supply and make any change that
7:03
you need before connecting it to the
7:05
power source once the system is
7:07
configured to the proper voltage and
7:09
it's connected to the power source you
7:11
can leave that switch exactly where it
7:13
is so now that we've talked about the
7:16
input to the power supply let's talk a
7:18
little bit about the output from the
7:20
power supply that is going to provide us
7:22
with a number of different voltages in
7:25
DC or direct current you often see these
7:28
DC values referenced as a positive value
7:31
and a negative value in reality it's
7:34
referring to the difference in potential
7:36
based on where you happen to be you can
7:38
think of this as measuring the heights
7:40
of your home from your front door if you
7:42
wanted to measure the second floor of
7:44
your house it would be approximately
7:46
positive 10 ft above you and if you were
7:49
measuring the basement it would be -10
7:51
ft both of those are 10 ft away but
7:54
obviously the distance is relative to
7:56
where you happen to be standing if you
7:59
look at your power supply documentation
8:01
you'll see there are a number of
8:02
different outputs that are available
8:04
from the back of that power supply one
8:07
of those is probably a positive 12vt
8:09
this is for PCI Express adapters hard
8:12
drives that you might install into a
8:14
system or anything else that needs that
8:17
much voltage to be able to operate you
8:19
may find some motherboards that use plus
8:21
5 volts for components that are on the
8:23
motherboard itself although many of our
8:25
newer motherboards tend to use plus 3.3
8:28
volts that 3.3 volt power is primarily
8:31
used for the motherboard to power up the
8:33
M.2 slots the RAM that's on your system
8:36
and the other assorted components on the
8:38
motherboard and you might also find that
8:41
your power supply provides plus 5 volts
8:43
of SB power this is the power provided
8:47
to the motherboard when it's in a
8:48
standby or sleeping state so that we can
8:51
wake it up using signals across the
8:53
network or by pushing a button on the
8:55
front of the case you may find some
8:58
motherboards using -12vt of DC power
9:01
this is often used for integrated local
9:03
area network connections on the
9:05
motherboard and there may be some older
9:07
PCI cards that use the -12 volts and for
9:11
older power supplies that are providing
9:13
power for legacy motherboards you might
9:15
see them providing a negative 5V this is
9:18
for an older style of adapter card
9:20
that's no longer used and you may find
9:22
that your power supply doesn't even
9:24
provide an output for neg 5 volts if
9:27
you're not sure the type of output and
9:29
how many amps are supported for each of
9:31
these voltages all of this is documented
9:34
in your power supplies manual you might
9:36
also see those values right on the side
9:39
of your power supply for easy
9:41
reference to get power to our
9:44
motherboard we have a main power
9:46
connection that is a 24 pin connector on
9:48
the motherboard itself and it provides
9:50
the motherboard with 3.3 volts 5 vols
9:54
and 12 volts of DC power this was
9:56
originally a 20 pin connector but most
9:59
modern motherboards are using the
10:01
full-size 24 pin connector to connect
10:03
the power supply to the motherboard if
10:06
you do run into one of these older
10:08
motherboards that only has a 20 pin
10:10
connector on the motherboard you can
10:12
still use the 24 pin power connector
10:14
from the power supply and simply not use
10:17
those last four pins that are on the
10:19
connector here's the 24 pin connector
10:21
you'll find on a motherboard and it is
10:23
probably one of the larger connectors
10:25
that you'll find on the motherboard
10:27
itself to be able to connect the power
10:29
from the power supply we simply take the
10:31
24 pin connector that is coming from the
10:33
power supply and place it into those
10:36
slots on the motherboard this can only
10:38
fit into this connector one way because
10:40
this entire connection is keyed which
10:43
prevents us from plugging it in with the
10:45
wrong orientation
10:47
if you're working with servers and other
10:49
infrastructure devices you may find that
10:51
there are multiple power supplies on the
10:53
back of the unit these are designed to
10:55
be redundant each power supply is
10:57
designed to support the full 100% power
11:00
required by the system so if you lose
11:03
one of those power supplies the other
11:05
power supply can continue to keep that
11:07
system up and running very commonly
11:09
these two power supplies will run at 50%
11:11
of the load and if you lose one of those
11:13
power supplies or it comes disconnected
11:16
from the power source the other power
11:18
supply will take 100% of that load these
11:22
are also designed to be hot swappable
11:24
you can see there's a switch on top of
11:26
this motherboard that allows you to
11:27
slide it out of the chassis even when
11:30
the system is up and running this means
11:32
that you can maintain 100% uptime but be
11:35
able to replace any of these power
11:37
supplies if you run into a problem
11:40
many less expensive power supplies will
11:42
have fixed connections coming out of the
11:44
power supply itself this means we'll
11:46
have a large grouping of cables that
11:47
will be sitting inside of our computer
11:49
case whether we're plugging a device
11:51
into those connections or not higherend
11:55
power supplies tend to be more modular
11:56
where you can simply connect only the
11:58
cables that you need to use inside of
12:00
that particular system and if you need
12:02
to add more later you can simply plug
12:04
them into that modular connection and if
12:06
you need to remove a device from your
12:08
computer you can remove those cables
12:10
from the inside of your case here's a
12:12
hybrid power supply that has some fixed
12:14
connectors but it also has modular
12:16
connectors that you can plug in if you
12:18
need them here's a power supply that is
12:20
completely modular you can see that they
12:23
provide all of the cables that you would
12:24
need to connect and you can simply plug
12:26
in the cables that you need to provide
12:28
power for your specific requirements
12:32
if you're purchasing a power supply
12:34
you'll notice there are different models
12:35
that will support a different number of
12:37
watts generally if you're getting a
12:39
power supply that supports a higher
12:41
wattage that power supply tends to be
12:44
more expensive you could certainly spend
12:46
the extra money to buy a power supply
12:48
that gives you much more capacity than
12:50
you'll ever need but that doesn't
12:52
provide you with any additional speed
12:53
benefit for your computer even though
12:56
different power supplies may support
12:58
different wattages the physical size of
13:00
the power supply doesn't tend to change
13:03
so if you're upgrading a power supply
13:05
inside of a computer case you might
13:07
upgrade to a higher wattage but the size
13:09
of the power supply itself will be
13:11
exactly the same inside of that case
13:14
if you're trying to decide just how many
13:16
watts you need in a power supply then
13:19
you'll need to calculate all of the
13:21
different components inside of your
13:22
computer and add up what the maximum
13:25
number of watts might be required for
13:27
all of those systems to work together so
13:30
you'll want to check your documentation
13:31
to see what the CPU requires for wattage
13:34
what your storage devices will need what
13:36
your video adapter requires and then any
13:38
other components inside of that system
13:41
if you have a separate video card inside
13:43
of your computer these usually require a
13:46
significant amount of power and you'll
13:48
want to check the documentation for that
13:50
video card to see what the requirements
13:52
are for power inside of that computer a
13:55
good rule of thumb is to get a power
13:56
supply that can support 50% of your
13:59
total load today that means that the
14:01
power supply will not be overloaded and
14:04
you'll have plenty of room for growth in
14:05
the future
14:07
another useful specification when you're
14:09
looking to purchase a power supply is
14:11
the energy efficiency when we're
14:13
converting from alternating current to
14:15
direct current we lose a bit of power
14:18
each time we make that conversion that
14:20
loss power is converted to heat which of
14:23
course creates more of a cooling issue
14:25
for the computer that you're using if
14:27
you're concerned about this efficiency
14:29
rating you may want to check the
14:30
different values associated with those
14:32
power supplies the standards tend to be
14:35
somewhere between 80 to 96% efficiency
14:38
depending on the quality of the power
14:40
supply that you're purchasing if you get
14:42
a power supply that's more efficient
14:44
then you'll have less power that is lost
14:46
during that conversion process and
14:48
because you're losing less power you
14:50
have a lot less heat in your system and
14:52
overall you're saving money not only in
14:54
powering the computer but keeping that
14:56
computer cool there's a certification
14:59
program that power supplies can go
15:01
through to determine their efficiency
15:03
you'll see power supplies rated as an 80
15:06
plus an 80 plus bronze silver gold
15:10
platinum or titanium this means that the
15:13
80 plus with no rating would be the
15:15
least efficient and an 80 plus titanium
15:18
would be the most efficient
