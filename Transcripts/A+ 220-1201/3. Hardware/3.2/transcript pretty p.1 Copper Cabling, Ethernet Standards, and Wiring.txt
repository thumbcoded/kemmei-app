## **Part 1: Copper Cabling, Ethernet Standards, and Wiring**

We often focus on the capabilities of our new laptop or desktop computer. When we connect these to the network, we naturally assume that everything will connect and work as expected. This is possible because we use the proper cables to send information across the network. These cables or fiber optics are the foundation of everything we send across the network. If you have bad cabling, your applications will not work as expected. You have to plan and install the correct cabling for the type of network you plan to use.

Even our wireless networks have cable at some point. We may communicate wirelessly to the access point, but that access point must be connected to the rest of the network over network cables. A huge number of the cables we use on our wired Ethernet networks are twisted pair copper cables. We refer to these as twisted pair because the individual wires inside the cable are twisted together into pairs. The blue pair is twisted together, as are the green, orange, and brown pairs. Each wire pair contains equal and opposite signals. The information sent over one part of the pair may be transmit plus, and the other wire in that pair is transmit minus.

The reason these wires are twisted inside the cable is that one side of the pair is constantly moving away from any interference or noise in the environment. When the signal is received on the other side, the receiver can determine what the real signal should be and what the interference might be, based on the differences in the signal received on both wires. If you look closely at the cable, you’ll notice that each wire pair is twisted at a different rate. The receiving side can compare all four wire pairs and see the differences in interference across all pairs at the same time. Since there are differences in the twist rate, the receiving device can easily see where the interference might be and where the good signal is inside the cable.

Different twisted pair cables may be constructed differently. There is a set of standards associated with these cables that determines the minimum capabilities for that particular twisted pair cable. Sometimes people refer to a cable as having a particular speed, but in reality, the cable doesn’t have a speed at all. The cable is just copper sitting there on the desk. The signals you send over the cable, however, do have a speed, and that speed is determined by the signal encoding sent over the wires.

To send those signals across the wire, we need to use a minimum category of cable for the type of signal we’re transmitting. The minimum category of cable for a particular Ethernet standard is documented in the IEEE 802.3 standard. These documents tell us the minimum category of cable supported for a particular Ethernet standard. For example, if you’re using gigabit Ethernet, you’re probably using the 1000BASE-T standard, and you need to use a minimum of category 5 cable. If you look at the outside of the cable, you’ll see printed on it what category it has been tested to. If you’re using 1000BASE-T, you need at least category 5. The category 5 standard has been deprecated, so if you’re buying new cable, you’ll probably find category 5e. Additional tests were added to the qualification for category 5 cable, so we label it as category 5e, with the E standing for enhanced.

If you have an older installation of category 5 wiring, you can run 1000BASE-T over that cable to a distance of 100 meters. If you’re installing new cable, you’re probably installing category 5e, which also supports 1000BASE-T to 100 meters. If you’re running 10 gigabit speeds, you may be using 10GBASE-T, which is 10 gigabit Ethernet over unshielded twisted pair cable, and you need a minimum of category 6 cable. Unshielded category 6 can run for 55 meters, while shielded category 6 can run for 100 meters. Category 6A, where the A stands for augmented, can run 10GBASE-T to 100 meters.

If you’re ever wondering what category of cable you should use, always refer to the IEEE standards. If you’re running a 10GBASE-T network, check the IEEE standards for the minimum category of cable supported for that Ethernet type.

Twisted pair cable is not the only type of copper cable you might find. Another common copper type is coaxial cable. Coaxial means two or more forms sharing a common axis. The inner conductor is where all the signal goes, and there is an outer shield to protect the signals running on the internal wire. Coax is often used for cable modems or digital cable. Anytime you’re running high-speed internet over cable infrastructures, you’re probably using a coaxial cable.

We also talked about unshielded and shielded cable. The type you use depends on the standards and how far you need the cable to go. Unshielded twisted pair, or UTP, has no shielding at all. There’s no shielding around the outside of all four pairs, and none around each pair. Shielded twisted pair uses a shield inside the cable to help protect against interference. This shield can be around all four pairs or around each individual pair. The outside of the wire often tells you what type of cable and shielding is used. U means unshielded, S refers to braided shielding, and F refers to foil shielding. The abbreviation on the cable specifies the shielding used for the overall cable, then a slash, then the abbreviation for the individual pairs, ending with TP for twisted pair. For example, S/FTP means braided shielding around the entire cable and foil around each pair. F/UTP means foil around the outside and no shielding for the individual pairs.

There are also direct burial STP cables designed to be installed in the ground. These are usually waterproofed and may have a gel inside to repel water. They are usually shielded twisted pair cables, which helps against interference and grounds the cable, adding strength. Structurally, they look similar to shielded Ethernet cables used inside a network, with four pairs of wires and a shield around all pairs. There’s often a wire running the length of the cable used as an electrical ground, sometimes called a drain wire.

In commercial buildings, you may see cables above a drop ceiling. Above the drop ceiling might be ductwork for air supply and return. If the airspace above the ceiling is not circulating, it’s not a plenum. In many environments, the return air goes into the open space above the ceiling, called plenum space. This makes it easy for fire, smoke, and toxic fumes to move freely, so network cables above the ceiling must be plenum-rated. Plenum-rated cables have a fire-rated jacket, such as fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or low-smoke PVC. These cables may be less flexible but are necessary for safety.

Ethernet wiring is standardized internationally. In the US, the TIA has created the ANSI/TIA-568 standard for cable installation in commercial buildings. This standard defines what wires go on what pins with which connectors. The T568A and T568B color schemes are used for RJ45 connections. The colors used in each standard are slightly different. In the US, T568B is most commonly used. Organizations are usually consistent with their wiring standards. You should never mix T568A on one end of a cable and T568B on the other. Understanding the color schemes is important for both exams and real-world cabling. The blue and brown colors are the same between the two standards, so you only need to memorize the differences for pins 1, 2, 3, and 6. You should be able to look at a cable and determine which color scheme was used. When crimping your own cables, it’s easy to get wrong, so always check the wires before crimping.

Sometimes you’ll use a jack where you punch down the cables, and the jack tells you what colors to use for each connection. The A colors are along the top, and the B colors are along the bottom. The jack may not follow the same color scheme as T568A or T568B, but internally it puts the correct pins in the right place on the RJ45 connector.
