we often focus on the capabilities of
0:04
our new laptop or our desktop computer
0:07
And when we connect these to the network
0:08
we naturally assume that everything will
0:11
connect and work as expected It's able
0:13
to do that because we were able to put
0:15
in the proper cables to be able to send
0:17
that information across the network
0:20
These cables or fiber optics are the
0:22
foundation of everything we send across
0:24
this network If you have bad cabling
0:26
then your applications are not going to
0:28
work as expected You have to plan and
0:30
install the correct cabling for the type
0:33
of network that you plan to use Even our
0:36
wireless networks have cable at some
0:38
point We may communicate wirelessly to
0:40
the access point That access point has
0:43
to be connected to the rest of the
0:44
network over those network
0:47
cables A huge number of the cables that
0:50
we use on our wired Ethernet networks
0:52
are twisted pair copper cables We refer
0:54
to these as twisted pair because the
0:56
individual wires inside of this cable
0:59
are twisted together into these pairs
1:01
You can see the blue pair is twisted
1:03
together the green pair the orange pair
1:05
and the brown pair Each one of those
1:07
wire pairs contains equal and opposite
1:10
signals So the information being sent
1:12
over one part of that pair may be
1:14
transmit plus The other wire in that
1:17
pair is transmit minus The reason that
1:20
these wires are twisted inside of this
1:22
cable is that one side of that pair is
1:26
constantly moving away from any
1:28
interference or noise that may be in the
1:30
environment around it When that signal
1:33
is received on the other side that
1:35
receiver is able to determine what the
1:37
real signal should be and what the
1:39
interference might be based on the
1:41
differences in that signal that it's
1:43
receiving on both of those wires And if
1:46
you look closely at the cable that
1:47
you're using you'll notice that each of
1:49
those wire pairs is twisted at a
1:52
different rate The receiving side can
1:54
compare all four of those wire pairs and
1:57
see the differences in that interference
1:59
across all of those pairs at the same
2:02
time And since there are differences in
2:04
the twist rate the receiving device can
2:06
easily see where the interference might
2:08
be and where the good signal might be
2:10
inside of that cable
2:13
Different twisted pair cables may be
2:16
constructed differently There is a set
2:18
of standards associated with these
2:19
cables that determines the minimum
2:22
capabilities for that particular twisted
2:24
pair cable Sometimes people refer to a
2:27
cable as having a particular speed In
2:29
reality of course the cable doesn't have
2:31
a speed at all The cable is just a bunch
2:33
of copper that's sitting there on the
2:35
desk The signals that you send over the
2:38
cable however certainly do have a speed
2:40
And that speed is determined by the
2:42
signal encoding that's being sent over
2:44
those individual wires To be able to
2:46
send those signals across the wire we
2:49
need to be using a minimum category of
2:51
cable for the type of signal that we're
2:54
transmitting The minimum category of
2:56
cable that should be used for a
2:58
particular Ethernet standard is
2:59
documented in the ITE 802.3 standard
3:03
document Those IE E documents tell us
3:05
the minimum category of cable that is
3:08
supported for a particular ITE Ethernet
3:10
standard For example if you're using
3:12
gigabit Ethernet on your network then
3:15
you're probably using the 1,00 b
3:18
standard that IE has created And they've
3:21
put into their standards document that
3:23
if you plan to run 1,00 b as your
3:26
Ethernet standard you need to use a
3:28
minimum of category 5 cable If you look
3:32
at the outside of the cable you'll see
3:34
printed on the cable itself what
3:36
category of cable this has been tested
3:38
to So if you're using 1,00 b you need to
3:42
make sure you're using a minimum of
3:44
category 5 The category 5 standard has
3:46
been deprecated So if you're buying new
3:48
cable you'll probably find category 5e
3:52
There were additional tests that were
3:53
added to the qualification for category
3:55
5 cable And those additional tests mean
3:58
that we need to label it with a slightly
4:00
different name of category 5e The E is
4:03
for enhanced So if you have an older
4:06
installation of wiring and it's category
4:08
5 you can run 1,00 b over that category
4:11
5 cable to a distance of 100 m If you're
4:14
installing new category 5 cable you're
4:16
probably installing category 5e And
4:19
obviously it can also support 1,00 b t
4:22
to a distance of 100 m If you're running
4:25
10 gigabit speeds then you may be
4:27
running 10 GBS T which is 10 GB Ethernet
4:30
over unshielded twisted pair cable And
4:33
you would need a minimum of category 6
4:36
cable If you're using category 6 cable
4:38
that is unshielded it can run for a
4:40
distance of 55 m And if this category 6
4:43
cable is shielded it can run for a
4:45
maximum of 100 m And if you're using
4:48
category 6A the A stands for augmented
4:51
then you can run that same 10GB T
4:53
network to a distance of 100 m If you're
4:56
ever wondering what category of cable
4:58
you should be using you should always
5:00
refer back to the Ale E standards So if
5:03
you're running a 10GB T network you
5:06
should look at the ILE E standards for
5:08
that and it will tell you the minimum
5:10
category of cable that is supported for
5:12
that specific Ethernet type
5:16
But of course twisted pair cable is not
5:17
the only type of copper cable you might
5:20
find Another common copper type is the
5:22
coaxial cable Coaxial meaning two or
5:25
more forms sharing a common axis
5:28
Co-axial This is an inner conductor This
5:31
is where all of the signal goes on that
5:33
wire conductor that's in the middle And
5:35
there is an outer shield that's commonly
5:37
associated with this to protect the
5:38
signals that are running on that
5:40
internal wire conductor You often see
5:42
coax being used for a number of
5:44
different purposes but for networking we
5:47
commonly see this associated with cable
5:49
modems or digital cable Anytime you're
5:52
running a high-speed internet over those
5:53
cable infrastructures you're probably
5:55
using a coaxial
5:57
cable In our discussion of cable
6:00
categories we talked about unshielded
6:02
cable and shielded cable And the type of
6:04
cable you would use would be dependent
6:06
on the standards that you're using and
6:08
how far you need that cable to go
6:10
Unshielded twisted pair we refer to as
6:13
UTP This is a cable that has no
6:15
shielding at all So there's no shielding
6:17
around the outside of all four pair and
6:19
there's no shielding around each pair of
6:21
cable either Another style of twisted
6:24
pair you might find is the shielded
6:26
twisted pair where a shield inside of
6:29
the cable itself is used to help protect
6:31
against interference This shield can be
6:33
around all four pair So you can see here
6:36
we have a shielded twisted pair where
6:38
the shield is along the outside But it
6:40
could be that you're shielding each
6:41
individual pair of wires within that
6:44
wire sheath as well If you look on the
6:46
outside of the wire it often will tell
6:48
you what type of cable and what type of
6:51
shielding is being used inside of the
6:54
cable sheath If you see abbreviations
6:56
that say U it's probably unshielded An
6:58
abbreviation of S refers to a braided
7:01
shielding and an abbreviation of F is
7:03
referring to a foil shielding If you see
7:06
this printed on the outside of the cable
7:08
it will usually have that abbreviation
7:10
specifying the shielding used for the
7:12
overall cable There'll be a slash
7:14
There'll be the abbreviation of what
7:16
shielding is used for the individual
7:18
pairs and that ends with TP to specify
7:20
that it is twisted pair So if you're
7:23
using a braided shielding around the
7:25
entire cable and then you're using foil
7:27
around each individual pair then the
7:30
abbreviation on the outside of the cable
7:31
should show
7:34
S/FTTP If you have a cable like this one
7:36
that has foil around the outside of the
7:39
cables and then no shielding for the
7:41
individual pairs then that is an
7:45
F/UTTP Here's a cable where we can see
7:47
the inside of the cable and the writing
7:49
on the outside of the cable You can see
7:51
this is a category 7 cable and it has
7:53
some text that says
7:55
S/FTTP This means that all of the wires
7:58
inside have a shield around them and
8:00
there's foil on each pair of the cable
8:03
And if we look at this cable we can see
8:05
the shield around the outside and we can
8:08
see that each individual pair of wires
8:10
does indeed have foil around each one of
8:13
those pair
8:15
If you work for an organization that has
8:16
multiple buildings next to each other or
8:18
you work on a campus of buildings then
8:21
you may run individual wires between one
8:23
building and another Some organizations
8:26
will run this wire overhead but it might
8:28
be much simpler and perhaps protect the
8:30
cable better if you were able to put it
8:31
underground There are speciallymade
8:33
Ethernet cables that are direct burial
8:36
STP cables They're designed to be
8:38
installed in the ground itself These are
8:41
usually waterproofed They may have a gel
8:43
inside the cable to help repel the water
8:45
so that you can put it in the ground and
8:47
not even have to use a conduit These are
8:50
usually shielded twisted pair cables not
8:52
only to help against interference but we
8:54
can also use that to help ground the
8:56
cable This also adds a bit of strength
8:58
especially if we're putting this cable
9:00
in the ground without a conduit
9:02
Structurally this looks very similar to
9:04
a shielded Ethernet cable that you would
9:06
use on the inside of a network You have
9:09
four different pairs of wires We might
9:11
also have a shield around all four of
9:13
those pairs to help protect against
9:15
interference And because this is going
9:17
outside usually in a place where water
9:19
might be we often will put a waterproof
9:22
gel on the inside of that to help
9:24
protect the wires even more There's also
9:26
usually a wire that runs the entire
9:28
length of the cable that's often used as
9:31
an electrical ground You'll sometimes
9:33
hear this referred to as a drain wire
9:36
If you're in a commercial building and
9:38
you look at the ceiling you're probably
9:40
not looking at the bottom of the roof
9:42
You're probably looking at the top of a
9:44
drop ceiling And there's additional
9:47
things above that ceiling that you can't
9:49
see Above that drop ceiling might be
9:52
some duct work that is able to feed air
9:54
into the rest of the building and
9:56
another set of duct work that's able to
9:58
take a return air supply and send it
10:01
back to the air conditioning system When
10:03
the airspace above that drop ceiling is
10:06
not circulating then we refer to this as
10:08
not having a plenum In many commercial
10:11
environments there's often an air supply
10:13
that is providing fresh air through a
10:15
set of duct work But the return air is
10:17
simply going into the large open air
10:20
space above the drop ceiling In this
10:22
case we refer to that open area as
10:24
plenum space One of the concerns that we
10:27
have and that we always have to plan for
10:29
is one a fire In these plenum
10:31
environments where you have all of this
10:33
open space above the drop ceiling makes
10:36
it very easy for fire smoke and toxic
10:39
fumes to be able to move freely from one
10:41
part of the building to another This
10:43
means if you're putting network cables
10:45
above that drop ceiling we have to use a
10:47
cable type that has been specifically
10:50
built for a plenum If you were to move
10:52
those drop ceiling tiles out of the way
10:54
you'd probably see something like this
10:56
where there's a number of different
10:57
cables and connections Some of them are
11:00
electrical some of them are for the fire
11:02
system and others might be for the
11:04
network runs from one part of the floor
11:06
to another A typical Ethernet cable that
11:09
is not something designed for the plenum
11:11
has a cable jacket that's commonly made
11:14
of polyvinyl chloride or PVC If you're
11:17
putting cables above the drop ceiling
11:19
then you're probably using a plenum
11:21
rated cable This has been specifically
11:24
designed to be a firerated type of cable
11:27
jacket That means that it is a
11:29
florinated ethylene polymer FEP or a low
11:32
smoke polyvinyl chloride or low smoke
11:36
PVC These are functionally the same as
11:38
any other type of Ethernet cable but
11:40
they may be a little more difficult to
11:42
work with because that type of cable
11:44
jacket may not be as flexible as the
11:47
other types of cables And although we
11:49
don't like to think about bad things
11:51
happening inside of our building we do
11:53
have to plan for the worst case scenario
11:55
And if you're designing a network where
11:57
you're putting these cables above a drop
11:59
ceiling you may want to make sure that
12:01
you're using a plenum rated cable

as you can imagine the standardization
0:04
for Ethernet wiring is one that extends
0:07
well past the borders of any country
0:09
there is an international standard
0:11
managed by the
0:13
ISOC181 cabling standards document that
0:16
defines the different classes of
0:18
networking standards in the US there's
0:21
the telecommunications industry
0:23
association or TIA this is a
0:26
standardsbased organization that has
0:28
created a standard for the installation
0:30
of cables in a commercial building you
0:33
can find this in the
0:35
ANC/TIA 568 standard inside of that
0:39
standards document is the definition of
0:42
what wires go on what pins with which
0:45
connectors when you're using an Ethernet
0:47
network we refer to the standardization
0:50
of the pins and the colors as the
0:53
T568A color scheme and the
0:56
T568B color scheme we need this set of
0:59
standards so that we can walk into any
1:01
building or look at any Ethernet cable
1:04
and see a consistent coloring of wires
1:06
no matter where we go this not only
1:09
helps with the process of the initial
1:10
cabling installation but it also helps
1:13
when troubleshooting that cable these
1:15
two standards of the T568A and T568B are
1:19
both used on the same RJ45 type
1:22
connection but you can see that the
1:24
colors used in each of these standards
1:26
is slightly different from each other in
1:29
the US and probably in most places
1:31
you'll find that the
1:32
T568B standard is what is commonly used
1:36
it would be unusual for an organization
1:38
to start with one standard and then
1:40
change over to a different standard in
1:42
the middle of their installation
1:43
normally organizations will be very
1:46
consistent with their wiring standards
1:47
and once an organization starts using a
1:50
particular standard that's the one they
1:51
normally will stay with you also want to
1:54
be careful about mixing and matching
1:56
these on a gigabit network you would
1:58
never put a T568A wiring scheme on one
2:01
end of a cable and the T568B colors on
2:04
the other end of the cable you may even
2:07
find references on the internet to tell
2:09
you that this is a crossover cable with
2:11
Ethernet but if you actually go through
2:13
and look at the pinouts you'll see that
2:15
that's not actually the case you would
2:17
never want to mix 568A with
2:21
568B understanding the color schemes is
2:23
not only important for the A+ exam it's
2:26
also important for any network that you
2:28
walk into where you'll need to perform
2:30
some type of crimping or cable
2:32
management this is something where the
2:34
T568A and
2:36
T568B will certainly be used but
2:39
fortunately there are a number of
2:41
similarities between these two you can
2:43
see on the T568A pin one starts with
2:46
white and green pin 2 is green then it
2:48
moves to white and orange blue white and
2:51
blue orange white and brown and brown
2:54
now if you compare that to the
2:55
T568B there are similarities for example
2:58
you can see that the blue colors on pins
3:01
four and five and the brown colors on
3:03
pins 7 and 8 are exactly the same
3:05
between them that means you only have to
3:07
memorize the differences between pins 1
3:09
and two and pins three and six you
3:12
should be able to pick up any Ethernet
3:14
cable look at the cable and be able to
3:16
determine which color scheme was used
3:19
for that particular cable for example we
3:21
have an Ethernet cable here we flipped
3:23
it over and you can see that it's white
3:25
and orange and orange it's white and
3:27
green and blue it's white and blue and
3:30
green and it's white and brown and brown
3:33
and if we were to take our T568B color
3:35
scheme and overlay it on the top of that
3:38
cable you can see that it matches
3:40
perfectly that means that this cable was
3:43
crimped with the
3:44
T568B color
3:46
standard this is something that is very
3:49
easy to get wrong if you're crimping
3:51
your own cables these little wires can
3:53
be difficult to manage and they're even
3:55
more difficult when you slide them into
3:57
the RJ45 connector just prior to
4:00
crimping them down it's often useful to
4:02
put the wires into the RJ45 before
4:05
crimping and then to look at the wires
4:07
just like we did in the previous slide
4:09
to see if they were matching up exactly
4:11
to where they should be and if they're
4:13
not we can pull the cable out readjust
4:15
put it back in and when we get it right
4:17
we can crimp those down
4:20
sometimes you'll run into a jack like
4:22
this one where you're punching down the
4:24
cables and they've already told you what
4:26
colors you should be using for each of
4:28
these different connections you can see
4:30
that the A colors are along the top and
4:32
the B colors are along the bottom you'll
4:34
also notice that this jack does not
4:36
follow the same color scheme as the
4:38
T568A or
4:40
T568B that's because they put the color
4:43
scheme here to make it easier for you to
4:45
install inside the internals of this
4:48
jack it will be putting the correct pins
4:50
in the correct place on the RJ45
4:53
connector itself here's another example
4:55
with a different keystone jack you can
4:58
see that there are four wires that go on
4:59
this side of the jack and four wires on
5:02
the other side of the jack this jack
5:04
shows us if you're using
5:06
T568A you would put a green a white and
5:09
green a blue and a white and blue into
5:11
those four areas and you would punch
5:13
them down if you're using 568B you would
5:16
use orange white and orange and blue and
5:19
white and blue and on the other side of
5:21
the jack are the other four wires and
5:23
you would put them in with the same
5:24
color scheme that's specified for either
5:27
T568A or T568B

if you walk into a data center you'll
0:03
find a great deal of equipment there
0:05
that runs using optical fiber Instead of
0:08
using copper with electrical signals to
0:11
transmit information from point A to
0:12
point B we send light through a fiber to
0:15
transmit that same information This
0:18
means we don't have to worry about the
0:19
interference that you might get from
0:21
other equipment or other radio frequency
0:24
devices This does make it a bit more
0:26
difficult to monitor or put a tap into
0:28
the connection You do need specialized
0:30
equipment if you're planning to use a
0:32
fiber optic network But unlike copper
0:35
signals which tend to degrade over a
0:37
short period in some cases you can
0:39
extend fiber optics many kilometers
0:42
without needing to regenerate that
0:44
signal And if you're working in an
0:46
environment with a lot of industrial
0:48
equipment or you're having to deal with
0:49
a lot of interference you could install
0:51
fiber optic connections and not worry
0:53
about any of those radio frequency
0:56
interference sources
0:58
One challenge with fiber optics is that
1:00
there are many different types of fiber
1:03
and many different types of connectors
1:05
And in this course we'll look at the
1:07
differences between all of these and
1:09
help you understand where the right
1:11
fiber is used in the right
1:13
situation Here's a nice cross-section of
1:15
a fiber optic cable You can see on one
1:17
side we are sending a light through the
1:20
fiber In this case the light is being
1:22
generated with an LED In some cases we
1:25
use a laser to be able to transmit that
1:27
light This moves through the fiber
1:29
optics on the core of that fiber We
1:32
refer to this as a high reflective index
1:34
core and it is surrounded with a low
1:36
reflective index cladding to help
1:38
protect it Because of the differences in
1:41
the reflective index the light bounces
1:43
back and forth through the fiber until
1:45
it reaches the other side This fiber
1:48
though is very thin and very fragile So
1:51
to help protect the core and the
1:52
cladding we surround it all with a
1:54
buffer coating Here's an image of the
1:57
end of a fiber optic connector You can
2:00
see the square shaped connector along
2:02
the outside In the center is this white
2:05
colored fereral This is a ceramic
2:07
fereral that helps protect the fiber
2:09
which is on the very inside of that
2:11
fereral If you look very closely you'll
2:14
see a discoloration That discoloration
2:16
is the fiber optic that's in the inside
2:19
that is well protected because it's
2:21
coated inside of that fereral That black
2:23
dot on the screen represents where the
2:25
fiber is inside of that fereral I'll
2:28
remove the black dot And now we can see
2:30
the discoloration That's your fiber
2:32
optic cable inside of that
2:36
connector You'll generally run into two
2:38
different types of fiber optic cables
2:40
One of them is a multiode fiber This is
2:43
commonly used inside of a building or
2:46
any type of short range communication
2:48
The distance on multi mode fiber tends
2:50
to vary but it can usually go to about 2
2:53
km in length Because of the short
2:56
distances that it needs to go we can use
2:58
a relatively inexpensive light source
3:00
And that's why we commonly will see LED
3:03
used as the light source on a multiode
3:05
fiber We refer to this as multiode fiber
3:08
because the fiber itself is relatively
3:11
large It has different modes that the
3:13
light can take as it moves through the
3:15
fiber Each time the light is going
3:17
through it may use a different path to
3:19
get from one side of the fiber to the
3:22
other This is very different than single
3:24
mode fiber Single mode fiber is designed
3:27
for long range communication and some
3:29
Ethernet standards can go 100 kilometers
3:31
through single mode fiber without any
3:33
need to regenerate that signal Because
3:36
it is going such an extended distance we
3:38
often will use lasers to be able to make
3:40
sure that the light can make it all the
3:43
way through that fiber connection And
3:45
unlike multiode fiber the single mode
3:47
fiber goes through the fiber in a single
3:50
mode You will notice that the core of
3:52
the fiber is much narrower than the
3:55
multiode fiber This is very common when
3:57
working with single mode fiber because
3:59
you have a single path through the
4:01
entire single mode connection

if you've connected any type of
0:03
peripheral device to your computer then
0:06
you've probably used a USB cable usb
0:09
stands for universal serial bus and it
0:11
has become the standard connection type
0:13
for our keyboards our mice and almost
0:16
any other device that we would directly
0:18
connect to our computer one of the first
0:21
versions of USB was USB version 1.1 it
0:25
had two different speeds that it
0:27
operated at one was what they called low
0:29
speed at 1.5 megabits per second and
0:32
another at full speed or 12 megabits per
0:35
second we generally saw 3 m in length as
0:39
the cable types for low speed and 5 m in
0:42
length for full speed usb 2.0 was a
0:45
significant improvement to the
0:47
throughputs of USB and it had a maximum
0:50
of 480 megabits per second again over a
0:54
cable that was approximately 5 m in
0:56
length and USB 3.0 is a standard they
0:59
call super speed it operates at 5 Gbits
1:02
per second over approximately a 3 m
1:05
cable we say approximately with these
1:07
cable types because the USB
1:09
specification does not specify an exact
1:12
cable length but generally speaking
1:14
these cable distances are about the
1:16
maximum you can get and still maintain
1:19
that level of throughput there have been
1:21
some updates to USB 3.0 including USB
1:24
3.1 which has a maximum of 10 Gbits per
1:28
second and USB 3.2 which has a maximum
1:31
of 20 Gbits per second
1:34
the cables and connectors used for USB
1:36
are relatively common and you've
1:38
probably seen one of these types of
1:40
cables before for USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 we
1:44
used these cable types many of us are
1:47
familiar with the standard A plug it is
1:49
a plug type that we continue to use
1:51
today if you're plugging in a peripheral
1:54
such as a printer or an external device
1:56
you may be connecting with a standard B
1:58
plug which has a bit more of a square
2:00
type connector and then if you're
2:02
connecting a mobile device it's probably
2:04
using one of the smaller connector types
2:06
such as a mini B plug and the microB
2:10
plug for USB 3.0 the connectors were
2:13
changed just a bit although the standard
2:15
A plug has the same form factor as the
2:18
previous version the standard B plug was
2:20
updated just a bit you can see it is a
2:23
little bit taller than the previous
2:24
version and the microB plug for USB 3.0
2:28
is a very different form factor than the
2:30
microb plug we used for USB 1.1 or USB
2:34
2.0 as you can see we've used a lot of
2:37
different connector types for USB
2:38
through the years and we realized that
2:40
we needed to standardized on one single
2:43
format we also needed a connector type
2:45
where you didn't have to plug it in in
2:47
any particular orientation the connector
2:50
type we created is called USB C and this
2:53
cable is one that can effectively
2:56
replace all of those other USB connector
2:58
types this USBC connector is a
3:02
description of the physical interface
3:04
that you would connect to a particular
3:06
device it does not describe the type of
3:08
signal going over that particular
3:10
connector and there could be many
3:12
different kinds of signal that you're
3:13
putting through a cable that is
3:15
ultimately connected with a USBC
3:17
connector side by side we can see that
3:20
the USBC plug is very similar in size to
3:23
the microB plug and you can see it next
3:26
to the standard A plug so that you can
3:28
get an idea of what the differences in
3:30
size might
3:32
be before we had the universal serial
3:35
bus we had simply a serial cable serial
3:38
cables had many different styles
3:40
connectors and formats but two of the
3:42
most popular were the DB9 and the
3:45
DB25 the standard size of DB9 refers to
3:49
the size of the connector the 25 is
3:52
referring to the number of pins so the
3:54
B-size connector is this longer size and
3:57
technically this smaller connector is an
4:00
Essiz connector this would be a DE9 but
4:04
since we were already using the term DB
4:06
for the 25 pin we kept the DB name and
4:10
refer to it as the DB9 connector but if
4:13
you're ever purchasing an older serial
4:14
cable you might see it referred to as
4:16
both DB9 and
4:19
DE9 these types of connections send
4:22
signals using a standard type called
4:24
RS232 that stands for recommended
4:27
standard 232 and it's been a standard
4:29
for sending serial information over
4:31
these wires since 1969 remember that we
4:34
were using these types of serial
4:36
connections well before there was USB
4:39
even before there were standards that
4:41
were in place for mice and keyboards so
4:44
back in the day if you were connecting a
4:46
modem a keyboard a mouse or some other
4:49
peripheral you may be connecting it
4:50
using one of these standard serial
4:52
cables and serial interfaces if you're
4:55
using one of these DB9 connectors these
4:58
days then you're probably connecting to
5:00
legacy equipment such as an older switch
5:02
or an older router this allows you to
5:05
connect to the serial or console port on
5:07
those devices to be able to configure
5:09
them many of us don't even have a DB9
5:12
type connector on the back of our
5:14
computer any longer and we've had to
5:16
convert between the newer USBC
5:19
connection to something like the older
5:21
DB9 connection
5:24
if you were to look at one of those
5:25
older switches or routers you would see
5:27
there was a console port this particular
5:29
console interface is an RJ45 connection
5:32
but it's not sending Ethernet through
5:34
that particular cable connection this is
5:36
instead sending serial information you
5:38
might also find console interfaces that
5:40
are DB9 connectors and some of the newer
5:43
switches or routers may simply have a
5:45
standard USB connection the reason we
5:48
need one of these serial cables and we
5:50
need to use the console connection is
5:52
that this is one of the best ways to
5:54
connect to this device when no other
5:56
method is available if there's problems
5:58
connecting to a device through one of
6:00
the existing interfaces that are on that
6:02
switch router or firewall you can always
6:05
connect to the console connection
6:07
through a serial interface and if you're
6:09
connecting to the console using the
6:11
serial interface you're probably put at
6:13
a command prompt and you're typing in
6:15
commands at the keyboard to be able to
6:17
configure that device and since most of
6:19
our modern devices don't have DB9
6:22
connectors but they do have USB
6:24
connections then we usually will carry
6:26
around some type of adapter cable that
6:28
will convert between the USB connection
6:30
to a DB9 and even from there we can
6:33
convert to the RJ45 just so we're able
6:36
to connect to one of these console
6:39
connections another method of connecting
6:41
to a peripheral is using a standard
6:43
known as Thunderbolt thunderbolt is a
6:45
high-speed serial connection that has
6:48
data and power on the same cable this
6:51
makes it very easy to power a peripheral
6:53
device through a single cable that's
6:55
running both the connection for data and
6:57
the connection for power the early
7:00
versions of Thunderbolt chose to use a
7:02
standard interface that was already
7:04
available on many systems this is a mini
7:07
display port connector and it was used
7:09
with Thunderbolt 1 to provide two
7:11
channels of throughput at 10 Gbits per
7:14
second per channel this obviously
7:16
allowed a total of 20 Gbits of total
7:19
throughput using Thunderbolt version 1
7:22
thunderbolt 2 improved on that
7:23
throughput by increasing it to 20 Gbits
7:25
for aggregated channels and you can see
7:28
that it still used the mini display port
7:30
connector if you're connecting to a
7:32
modern device using Thunderbolt then
7:34
you're probably not using the older
7:36
style mini display port connector
7:38
instead we're using that newer
7:40
standardized connector the USBC this is
7:43
a good example of how this USBC plug can
7:46
be used for many different purposes and
7:48
for Thunderbolt 3 we're able to get 40
7:50
GBs of aggregated throughput using that
7:53
USBC connector thunderbolt 3 supports a
7:56
maximum cable length of 3 m if you're
7:59
using a copper cable but it also
8:01
supports optical connectivity up to 60 m
8:04
in length and Thunderbolt allows you to
8:07
daisy chain devices from one to the
8:09
other so you don't have to have all of
8:11
the devices directly connected to the
8:13
computer you could have the computer
8:14
connect to a monitor have that monitor
8:16
connect to another monitor and have that
8:19
second monitor connect to an external
8:21
storage device thunderbolt 3 knows what
8:23
devices are connected in that chain and
8:25
it knows exactly what device to be able
8:27
to send and receive information from the
8:30
newer Thunderbolt 4 standard still
8:32
provides 40 Gbits of aggregated
8:34
throughput but it improves its video
8:36
output to support dual 4K displays this
8:40
also increases bandwidth to the PCI
8:42
Express bus allowing much more data to
8:44
be transferred from the motherboard to
8:46
these peripheral devices


if you're connecting a computer to a
0:03
screen or really any type of consumer
0:06
electronics to a video display device
0:09
then you're probably using HDMI this
0:12
stands for highdefinition multimedia
0:14
interface this sends both audio and
0:17
video through the same digital
0:19
connection and it has about a 20 meter
0:22
maximum range before you start to lose
0:24
too much signal and start seeing
0:26
blockiness on the screen this is one of
0:29
the most common connector types that
0:31
you'll find on today's monitors and
0:33
televisions it's a 19pin connector and
0:36
it's referred to an HDMI as a typea
0:39
connector here's a video adapter that
0:42
has a number of different outputs it has
0:44
DVI and display port but it also has a
0:47
HDMI connection right here at the bottom
0:50
you can see that it's almost in the
0:51
shape of a rectangle but the bottom
0:53
corners are indented in just a bit which
0:56
means that an HDMI cable would be the
0:58
only thing that would fit into that
1:00
interface on that picture of the display
1:03
adapter we saw that one of those
1:04
interfaces was a display port interface
1:07
display port is a video format that is
1:10
also able to send audio and video over
1:12
the same connection and it was one of
1:14
the first display type connections that
1:16
sent it in a packetized form very
1:18
similar to how you might send
1:20
information over an Ethernet network
1:22
this also has some compatibility with
1:24
both HDMI and DVI you can use a passive
1:28
adapter to convert between display port
1:30
to HDMI or display port to DVI on some
1:34
devices you may find that the display
1:36
port interface is the smaller style
1:38
known as the mini display port but on
1:41
desktop computers and video interface
1:43
cards you'll probably find the full-size
1:45
display port connector notice that the
1:47
display port connector has small little
1:50
locks along the top of the connector and
1:53
when you plug it into the interface it
1:54
tends to lock in place this means that
1:57
connector will not accidentally pull out
1:59
of that connector and usually there's a
2:01
button along the top or the sides of the
2:03
connector that allow you to unlock the
2:06
connection so you can pull it out of the
2:08
interface if you are trying to
2:09
disconnect a cable connection from a
2:11
computer and you notice that it's not
2:13
coming out of that connection then it
2:15
probably is a display port interface and
2:17
you'll need to press down on that button
2:19
before removing it from the
2:21
computer here's another video card with
2:23
many different types of video outputs
2:25
not just DVI and HDMI but a number of
2:28
different display port connections
2:30
you'll notice that display port and HDMI
2:32
are similar to each other at least in
2:35
size but they are very different in
2:37
their form factor you'll notice the
2:39
display port is a bit of a rectangle
2:41
with one of the corners that's a little
2:43
bit slanted that means that you can't
2:45
accidentally plug in HDMI to display
2:48
port or vice
2:50
versa if you're working with some older
2:52
systems you may run into a DVI interface
2:56
that stands for digital visual interface
2:58
one of the challenges with DVI is that
3:01
it's a single connector type with
3:03
multiple types of connections so you can
3:05
see there's a DVIA a DVID single link
3:09
DVID dual link and so on as the name
3:12
implies a single link and a dual link
3:14
video connection are able to send
3:16
different amounts of traffic effectively
3:18
doubling on the dual link connection a
3:21
single link can transmit information at
3:23
approximately 3.7 Gbits per second which
3:26
is able to support a traditional HD
3:28
connection which is 1920x 1200 in
3:31
resolution we saw with HDMI and display
3:34
port that we were able to send both
3:36
audio and video through the same
3:38
connection if you're plugging into a DVI
3:40
connection you are only sending video
3:42
signals through that connector you might
3:45
also run into some other variations of
3:47
DVI such as the DVIA that's able to send
3:50
analog signals this is a standard
3:52
connector that is able to coexist or be
3:55
backwards compatible with VGA we'll look
3:58
at VGA connectors in just a moment dvid
4:01
connectors are sending digital
4:03
information and if you run into a DVI
4:06
connection that is a DVI integrated
4:09
connection it can send both digital and
4:11
analog signals in the same
4:14
connector if you are working with DVI
4:17
make sure you look at the connector
4:18
that's on your computer and the
4:20
connector that you're using for your
4:21
cable to make sure you're using the
4:23
proper connection for both of those
4:25
devices and depending on the video card
4:28
that you're using you might have an
4:29
option as to which DVI connector you
4:32
might use so it's important to know that
4:34
there are differences and you'll need to
4:36
make the right decision over which
4:37
interface would be the best one to use
4:39
for your
4:41
purposes legacy equipment tends to use a
4:43
video standard known as VGA this is the
4:46
video graphics array standard vga uses
4:49
this standard connector we refer to as a
4:52
DB15 connector there are 15 pins inside
4:55
of the connector and the connector
4:56
itself is shaped like the letter D the
4:59
size of this connector is an Eshape
5:02
technically speaking this is called a
5:05
DE15 but you'll also see it commonly
5:07
written as
5:08
DB15 you'll also notice that VGA
5:11
connectors tend to have a very standard
5:13
blue color associated with them that's
5:15
because there are a series of
5:17
standardized colors that were rolled out
5:19
as part of a PC system design guide vga
5:22
very similar to DVI only sends video
5:25
signals through this link we don't send
5:27
any audio over these VGA connectors and
5:30
because this is an analog signal we tend
5:33
to start seeing a degrading of signal
5:35
once we get past 5 or 10 m of total
5:38
cable length here's the back of a
5:41
motherboard that supports a number of
5:43
different video types there is HDMI
5:46
plugged into a connector we can see
5:48
there is VGA on this motherboard this
5:50
motherboard also supports a DVI
5:53
connection although we tend to see a
5:55
number of different video standards
5:57
fortunately the connector types are very
5:59
different between all three so it should
6:01
be very easy to differentiate between
6:04
VGA DVI and
6:07
HDMI these days we're also sending a lot
6:09
of video signals over a USBC connector
6:13
usbc is a connector type and there could
6:15
be a number of different signals going
6:17
across that particular cable for example
6:19
USB could be sending power or serial
6:22
data over that connection but we could
6:24
also put Thunderbolt data display port
6:26
HDMI and a type of connections for
6:29
mobile devices called a mobile
6:30
highdefinition link or MHL this means
6:34
some devices are able to send many
6:36
different types of signals over that
6:37
same USB connection and all we need is
6:40
to provide the right cable and the right
6:42
connection

if you're connecting a hard drive inside
0:03
of a desktop computer then you're
0:05
probably using a standard interface
0:07
known as SATA This is a serial AT
0:10
attachment and there have been a number
0:12
of different versions of SATA through
0:14
the years There was a SATA revision 1.0
0:17
that supported 1.5 Gbits per second
0:20
Version 2.0 doubled the speed to 3 Gbits
0:22
per second Version 3.0 doubled the speed
0:25
again to 6 Gbits per second With SATA
0:27
revision 3.2 two the speeds increased to
0:30
16 Gbits per second And there is an
0:33
external version of SATA known as ESATA
0:36
It's very similar in functionality to
0:38
the internal version of SATA and it
0:41
supports connecting an external drive
0:43
over a cable that's approximately 2 m in
0:46
length The SATA standard supports two
0:49
physical connections on the back of
0:51
these storage drives one that is 15 pins
0:54
the longer connector is used for power
0:56
and the smaller connector which is seven
0:58
pins is used for data This particular
1:01
drive not only supports the SATA power
1:03
connection but it also supports the
1:05
older style Molex power connector With
1:08
SATA there is a direct connection
1:10
between the drive itself and the
1:12
motherboard connector It's a onetoone
1:14
relationship So the one cable that
1:16
you're plugging in for power has a
1:18
single cable that's plugging into your
1:20
power source or your power supply The
1:22
other cable used for data is a single
1:24
cable that's running from the storage
1:26
drive to the data connector on the
1:28
motherboard SATA doesn't support any
1:31
type of daisy chaining or multiple
1:33
drives on a single cable So this makes
1:35
it very easy to understand If there are
1:38
eight SATA interfaces on a motherboard
1:40
it can support eight total drives The
1:44
SATA connectors are very easy to pick
1:46
out on a motherboard such as this one
1:48
You can see the SATA connectors are here
1:49
closer to the bottom of this motherboard
1:52
If we zoom up a bit you can see this
1:54
motherboard supports both SATA 2 and
1:56
SATA 3 standard connectors And it looks
1:59
like there's a total of six connectors
2:01
on this motherboard Here's another
2:03
motherboard with a slightly different
2:05
alignment of SATA connections And this
2:07
motherboard appears to support four
2:09
different SATA data connections As I
2:11
mentioned before it's a onetoone
2:13
relationship between the connector on
2:15
the motherboard and the connector on the
2:17
storage drive You can see we have a blue
2:19
orange and black cable coming from the
2:21
SATA connections on this motherboard and
2:23
they're corresponding to the blue orange
2:25
and black data connectors on these
2:27
drives This is obviously only half of
2:30
the connections that we'll need for
2:31
these drives to operate They'll need
2:33
power So we need to plug in the SATA
2:35
power connectors on each of these drives
2:38
It's relatively straightforward to
2:40
connect a SATA drive You obviously have
2:42
the data connection and the power
2:44
connection To be able to connect the
2:46
drive to the data line we simply plug in
2:48
the data cable And now we have a
2:50
connectivity between this drive and the
2:53
motherboard As I mentioned earlier there
2:56
are not only standards for internal SATA
2:58
connections but there's also a standard
3:00
for an external SATA connection And
3:02
these are different types of connectors
3:05
The signal sent across the wire is
3:07
effectively the same between the
3:09
internal and external drive but the
3:11
connector itself is slightly different
3:13
between the two It's difficult to put
3:16
these side by side because obviously the
3:18
SATA standard is generally on the inside
3:20
of the computer and the ESATA standard
3:23
is almost always on the outside of the
3:25
computer But you can see the SATA
3:27
connection has that very distinctive
3:29
Lshape associated with it And that cable
3:32
is very different than the one you would
3:34
use for ESATA which has a completely
3:36
different style And you obviously can't
3:38
plug an ESATA into a SATA connection and
3:41
vice versa If you're using an ESATA you
3:44
will need an ESATA cable And if you're
3:46
plugging in internally to a SATA drive
3:48
you will need a SATA cable So if you're
3:51
looking at the back of your computer and
3:52
you see a couple of connectors that you
3:54
may not immediately recognize have a
3:56
closer look Those might be ESATA
3:58
connections


in your IT career you will have many
0:04
instances where you need a certain type
0:06
of cable but you don't have that exact
0:08
cable in your tool bag however there may
0:11
be ways to put multiple devices cables
0:14
and adapters together to create the type
0:17
of interface you need sometimes these
0:19
connections are electrically compatible
0:21
with each other and you simply need a
0:23
cable that has one type of connector on
0:25
one side and another type of connector
0:27
on the other but occasionally you'll
0:29
need to convert from one format to
0:32
another so there may be some additional
0:34
processing that occurs or power that's
0:36
required to facilitate that process most
0:40
of these adapters and converters are
0:42
designed for temporary use although
0:44
sometimes they do turn into more of a
0:46
permanent connection
0:49
when we were moving from DVI connections
0:51
to HDMI we tended to use a lot of DVI to
0:54
HDMI cables or DVI to HDMI adapters this
0:59
is because DVID the digital version of
1:02
DVI and HDMI which is also a digital
1:05
standard are electrically compatible
1:07
with each other so you could connect one
1:09
end of the cable to DVID the other end
1:12
of the cable to HDMI and you'd be able
1:15
to send that video signal from one
1:16
device to the other without any type of
1:19
signal conversion the DVI to HDMI
1:22
converter is very similar to the cable
1:24
it's much smaller of course but it does
1:26
provide a way to convert from one format
1:29
to the other
1:31
another useful backwards compatibility
1:33
is between DVIA the analog version of
1:36
DVI and VGA both of those two signal
1:40
types will work with each other although
1:41
technically only 640x480 resolution is
1:45
officially supported but since they are
1:47
both analog connections you might just
1:49
need a simple adapter to change from the
1:52
VGA 15 pin connector to the larger DVI
1:56
connection if you're moving from the
1:58
analog VGA connection to a digital
2:00
version of DVI then you will need some
2:03
type of signal conversion to be able to
2:05
convert between those two formats but in
2:08
a pinch these types of converters can
2:10
come in handy especially when you just
2:12
need to make a quick change between one
2:14
video standard and
2:16
another if you have a newer laptop one
2:18
of the things you might notice is that
2:20
those laptops are getting thinner and
2:22
thinner and suddenly we've now realized
2:25
there's not enough space to put a
2:27
full-size RJ45 Ethernet connection on
2:30
our newer laptops but in many cases we
2:33
still need wired connectivity to be able
2:35
to connect to other devices this means
2:38
you might need some type of adapter or
2:40
converter that can change USB
2:42
connectivity into an Ethernet connection
2:45
if you don't want to rely on wireless
2:47
connectivity everywhere you go or you
2:49
might need wired connectivity to
2:50
directly connect to a device or to
2:52
perform network troubleshooting then
2:54
having one of these converters in your
2:56
bag can be very
2:57
useful another challenge you might run
3:00
into is that many of these laptops no
3:02
longer have the larger USBA type
3:05
connectors for that reason we might need
3:08
another type of adapter that's able to
3:10
convert from USBC to USBA that would
3:13
then allow us to plug in a USBA
3:16
peripheral sometimes these are longer
3:18
cables so you can move them away from
3:20
that smaller interface on the laptop
3:22
itself or it might be a simple adapter
3:25
that you plug in that would give you
3:26
access to a USBA connection
3:30
and if you're not sure exactly what type
3:32
of connector you might need or you just
3:34
like to be planning for any particular
3:36
contingency you might want to get a USB
3:39
hub this plugs into your laptop over a
3:41
USB connection and provides a number of
3:44
different outputs on the USB hub itself
3:47
this particular hub supports USB SD
3:50
memory connectors HDMI Ethernet and
3:53
other types of connections

we'll start our conversation of copper
0:04
connectors with one that is relatively
0:06
common an RJ11 connector this is a six
0:09
position connector with two conductors
0:12
inside sometimes you may see this
0:14
written as
0:15
6P2C sometimes you'll see this with four
0:18
wires or four conductors inside which
0:20
technically makes it an RJ14 but
0:23
generally speaking we call them all RJ11
0:26
connectors this is the type of connector
0:28
that you will commonly use if you're
0:29
plugging into an analog telephone
0:31
connection or more recently a DSL or
0:35
digital subscriber line connection so if
0:37
your internet connection uses these
0:39
telephone cables to bring in that
0:41
digital signal with DSL then you're
0:44
using an RJ11 connector a larger version
0:47
of this modular connector is an RJ45
0:50
that stands for register jack 45 this is
0:54
an eight position connector with eight
0:56
conductors inside and you can count all
0:58
eight of those conductors in this single
1:01
connection this is also referred to as a
1:03
modular connection sometimes we refer to
1:06
it as an Ethernet connection because it
1:08
is very commonly used for Ethernet
1:10
networks but RJ45 connectors can be used
1:13
for serial connections and many other
1:15
connection types as well there are
1:17
slight differences in the size of an
1:19
RJ11 versus an RJ45 they're next to each
1:23
other here on the back of this DSL modem
1:25
you can see the RJ11 is slightly smaller
1:28
than the RJ45 connection unfortunately
1:32
this makes it very easy to make a
1:33
mistake if you're reaching behind a
1:35
device to plug things in because you
1:38
could accidentally plug in an RJ11
1:40
connector into an RJ45 connection the
1:43
RJ45 connector of course is too large to
1:46
fit into the RJ11 so you'll just need to
1:49
double check and make sure that when
1:50
you're plugging in RJ11 that you're
1:52
really plugging it into the appropriate
1:55
interface one common type of coax copper
1:58
connection is an F connector the F
2:01
connector is commonly used for cable
2:03
television connections and of course
2:05
this also extends into the cable modem
2:07
connection obviously your coax is coming
2:10
in from your cable provider or internet
2:12
service provider and the F connector
2:14
commonly has this threaded connection at
2:17
the end so that you can screw it into
2:19
the connection and it's not easily going
2:21
to be removed from that connection
2:23
without unscrewing it in the very middle
2:25
of this coax is the single copper
2:27
connector that's used to send and
2:29
receive signals over that cable
2:31
connection if you were to look at the
2:33
specifications for your cable modem you
2:35
would see that it follows the standard
2:37
of DOCSIS which is data over cable
2:39
service interface specification and that
2:42
DOCIS modem that you're using for your
2:44
cable modem is connecting to the cable
2:47
modem network using that F connector
2:50
here's the connection on the back of a
2:51
cable modem you've got the female F
2:53
connector on the cable modem itself and
2:55
this is the coax cable with an F
2:57
connector on the end of it that's used
2:59
to screw into that cable modem
3:01
connection
3:03
if you're working in a building where
3:05
there are hundreds or even thousands of
3:07
twisted pair cables then you may have
3:09
large walls of punchdown blocks that are
3:11
used to terminate those wires these
3:14
punchdown blocks are used because they
3:16
are very fast you can simply push the
3:18
wire into the connection and punch it
3:20
down with the appropriate tool and it's
3:22
also relatively inexpensive you don't
3:24
have to put an individual connector on
3:26
each individual wire you simply place
3:29
the wires into the appropriate spot on
3:31
the punchdown block you use your
3:33
punchdown tool to quickly attach those
3:35
wires into the block and now you can
3:38
move to the next set of wires here's a
3:40
closer view of the unshielded twisted
3:42
pair cable that has the individual wires
3:44
inside and you can see the eight wires
3:46
on the inside of this cable have been
3:48
punched down into the eight connections
3:50
on this punchdown block if you look
3:53
closely you can even see the metal
3:54
contacts on the inside of the punchdown
3:56
block that are able to pierce the
3:58
insulation of these wires and make
4:00
contact with the copper that's inside
4:03
here's a similar punchdown block in this
4:05
case the wires are run on the outside
4:07
and the wires themselves are
4:09
individually punched down to the
4:11
individual connectors on the punchdown
4:14
block some of the most common copper
4:16
connectors you'll run into are USB or
4:19
universal serial bus if you're running
4:21
USB version 1.1 or 2.0 then you'll
4:24
probably see a standard A plug very
4:26
similar to this one the standard B plug
4:29
is a more square plug that's used for
4:31
peripherals and if you're using a mobile
4:33
device you're probably using a mini B
4:35
plug or a microB plug if you're running
4:38
a later version of USB for example USB
4:41
3.0
4:42
Your A plug is very similar in size to
4:44
the previous version but you'll notice
4:46
the standard B plug and the microB plug
4:49
are very different in this newer version
4:51
of USB we realized having all of these
4:54
different USB interfaces creates
4:56
additional cables and additional
4:58
confusion so instead we have
5:00
encapsulated all of these different
5:02
connector types into one single type of
5:04
USB connector called USB C usbc is the
5:09
physical connector type which means we
5:11
can run different types of signal over
5:13
that same connector for example you
5:15
could run USB connections over this
5:17
Thunderbolt HDMI and many other types of
5:21
signals if you're working in an older
5:23
desktop you may find that there is a
5:25
four pin power connector used to power a
5:27
number of peripherals inside of that
5:30
computer this four pin connector is
5:32
referred to as a Molex connector
5:34
technically speaking the connector
5:36
itself was created by a company named
5:38
the Molex Connector Company so to call
5:40
this a Molex connector is only one of
5:43
many different kinds of connectors made
5:45
by the Molex Connector Company you'll
5:47
also see this connector referred to as
5:49
an amp matein lock this is a connector
5:52
that provides power for fans storage
5:54
drives and other components inside of
5:56
your computer and it commonly provides
5:58
12volt and 5V power you'll often see the
6:02
Molex connector paired with the power
6:04
input for the fan or storage drive that
6:06
you need to power these are relatively
6:09
modular and they often connect to each
6:10
other with simply friction so it's
6:12
relatively easy to disconnect and
6:14
reconnect them again if you look at one
6:17
of these older power supplies you'll see
6:19
that Molex connectors are included with
6:21
the other connector types for that power
6:23
supply if we look a little closer you
6:25
can see other connectors such as the
6:27
main motherboard power and of course
6:29
there are the Molex connectors that are
6:31
used to power those internal
6:33
peripherals many of our newer mobile
6:36
devices use USB connections to be able
6:38
to connect to power and data sources but
6:41
if you're using an older device from
6:43
Apple you may be using a lightning
6:45
connector lightning is an Apple
6:47
proprietary connector so you'll only see
6:49
this used with other Apple products and
6:51
it's usually associated with iPhones
6:54
iPads and other similar devices when
6:57
lightning was introduced micro USB was
6:59
the style of connector that we commonly
7:01
saw on mobile devices but Apple wanted
7:04
some additional power capabilities for
7:06
their phones and their tablets and they
7:08
wanted a connector that could be
7:09
inserted either way and still operate
7:11
normally although the industry is moving
7:14
towards USBC as a standard you may still
7:17
find some devices using these lightning
7:20
connections if you're a system
7:22
administrator or a network
7:23
troubleshooter then you'll need a DB9
7:26
connection to connect to some of the
7:27
older switches routers firewalls and
7:30
other devices these DB9 connectors
7:32
commonly transmit serial communication
7:35
and the standard for that communication
7:36
is RS232
7:38
stands for recommended standard 232 and
7:41
it's been around in the industry since
7:43
about 1969 these days we commonly use
7:46
USB as our standard form of serial
7:48
communication but before we had USB we
7:51
had RS232 running over these DB9
7:54
connections so if you were plugging in a
7:56
modem or a mouse you were probably using
7:59
DB9 these days we still keep these in
8:02
our bags because there are a number of
8:04
switches routers and other
8:05
infrastructure devices that use this
8:08
type of connector as their console port
8:10
if you need to be able to directly
8:12
connect to these devices and configure
8:14
them at a command prompt then you'll
8:16
want to use the serial port connection
8:18
that often is using a DB9 interface


if you're working with fiber optics
0:03
there are a number of standard
0:05
interfaces you might find one of these
0:07
interface types is an ST interface which
0:10
is a straight tip you can see the
0:13
straight tip at the end of the connector
0:15
and this is a style of connector that is
0:17
a bayonet connector which means you push
0:19
it in and slightly twist it to lock it
0:21
in place to be able to remove it you
0:24
need to untwist it and then remove it
0:26
from the connector this push and turn
0:28
bayonet ensures that the fiber stays in
0:30
place and can't accidentally be pulled
0:32
out of the connector here's a closer
0:35
view of the straight tip and you can see
0:37
the bayonet function on the side where
0:39
you would push it in and then slightly
0:41
turn it to lock it in
0:43
place another more modern style of
0:45
connector is the SC connector or the
0:48
subscriber connector you might also see
0:51
this referred to as a square connector
0:53
or a standard connector this style of
0:55
connector also locks in place but
0:57
instead of using a bayonet you push it
1:00
in and it locks you would need to
1:01
slightly pull on the outside of the
1:03
connector to be able to unlock it so
1:06
that it can be removed from that
1:07
interface this is a popular style of
1:09
connector and it's used across many
1:11
different devices patch panels and other
1:13
components within the data center this
1:15
style of connector can be used with
1:17
individual fibers or you can combine
1:19
them together as one single unit with a
1:22
pair of fiber inside this makes it very
1:25
easy to connect and disconnect both the
1:27
send and receive side from a connection
1:30
all at the same
1:31
time there's always a need to fit more
1:34
connections into a smaller amount of
1:36
space in order to do this with fiber you
1:39
could use a Lucent connector or an LC
1:42
connector this is a much smaller more
1:44
compact connection and this one holds in
1:46
place with a clip that's on the top of
1:48
the connector you might also see this
1:50
connection type referred to as a local
1:53
connector or a little connector here's a
1:55
better view of an LC connector with both
1:58
sides of it connected together so that
2:00
you can easily connect and disconnect a
2:02
pair of fibers
2:04
simultaneously and here's all three of
2:06
the connectors together the ST connector
2:09
the SC connector and the LC you can see
2:12
the ST is probably the largest of the
2:14
three the SC is certainly in the middle
2:17
and obviously the LC is much smaller
2:19
than either of them all of these
2:21
connectors work effectively the same way
2:23
they allow you to connect and disconnect
2:25
from a fiber connection you obviously
2:28
want to be sure that the connectors that
2:29
you're using match the same connectors
2:31
on the devices you're connecting to and
2:34
in many cases it will be an ST SC or LC
2:37
connection
