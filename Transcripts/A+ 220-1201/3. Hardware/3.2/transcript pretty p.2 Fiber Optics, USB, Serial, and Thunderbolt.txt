## **Part 2: Fiber Optics, USB, Serial, and Thunderbolt**

If you walk into a data center, you’ll find a lot of equipment that runs using optical fiber. Instead of using copper with electrical signals, we send light through a fiber to transmit information. This means we don’t have to worry about interference from other equipment or radio frequency devices. However, it’s more difficult to monitor or tap into the connection, and you need specialized equipment for fiber optic networks. Unlike copper signals, which degrade over short distances, fiber optics can extend many kilometers without needing to regenerate the signal. In environments with a lot of industrial equipment or interference, fiber optic connections are ideal.

One challenge with fiber optics is that there are many different types of fiber and connectors. A fiber optic cable has a core where the light travels, surrounded by cladding with a lower reflective index to keep the light inside. The core and cladding are protected by a buffer coating. There are two main types of fiber optic cables: multimode and single mode. Multimode fiber is used for short-range communication, typically up to about 2 kilometers. It uses an inexpensive light source, usually an LED. The fiber is relatively large, and the light can take different paths through the fiber. Single mode fiber is designed for long-range communication, with some standards supporting up to 100 kilometers without regeneration. Single mode fiber uses lasers and has a much narrower core, allowing the light to travel in a single path.

If you’ve connected any peripheral device to your computer, you’ve probably used a USB cable. USB stands for Universal Serial Bus and is the standard connection for keyboards, mice, and almost any other device. USB 1.1 operated at low speed (1.5 Mbps) and full speed (12 Mbps), with cable lengths of 3 meters for low speed and 5 meters for full speed. USB 2.0 increased throughput to 480 Mbps over a 5-meter cable. USB 3.0, called SuperSpeed, operates at 5 Gbps over a 3-meter cable. USB 3.1 supports 10 Gbps, and USB 3.2 supports 20 Gbps.

USB connectors have evolved over time. USB 1.1 and 2.0 used standard A and B plugs, as well as mini B and micro B plugs for mobile devices. USB 3.0 updated the B and micro B plugs. To standardize, the USB-C connector was created. USB-C can replace all previous USB connector types and can be plugged in either orientation. USB-C describes the physical interface, not the type of signal, so many different signals can be sent over a USB-C cable.

Before USB, we used serial cables, such as DB9 and DB25 connectors. DB9 refers to the size of the connector, and DB25 refers to the number of pins. These connections use the RS232 standard, which has been around since 1969. Serial connections were used for modems, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals before USB. Today, DB9 connectors are used for legacy equipment like older switches and routers, allowing you to connect to the serial or console port for configuration. Modern computers often lack DB9 connectors, so we use adapters to convert USB-C to DB9 or RJ45 for console connections.

Another method of connecting peripherals is Thunderbolt, a high-speed serial connection that carries data and power on the same cable. Thunderbolt 1 used the mini DisplayPort connector and provided two channels of 10 Gbps each. Thunderbolt 2 increased throughput to 20 Gbps. Modern Thunderbolt uses the USB-C connector, providing 40 Gbps of aggregated throughput. Thunderbolt 3 supports copper cables up to 3 meters and optical cables up to 60 meters. Thunderbolt allows daisy chaining devices, so you can connect multiple devices in a chain. Thunderbolt 4 maintains 40 Gbps throughput and improves video output to support dual 4K displays, increasing bandwidth to the PCI Express bus.
