0:02
troubleshooting printer issues can be
0:04
challenging you never know if the issue
0:05
is related to an application a printer
0:08
driver the operating system or the
0:10
printer itself one of the ways that you
0:12
can narrow down this problem is by
0:14
printing a test page from your operating
0:16
system in Windows there's a built-in
0:19
function to create a test page this
0:21
means that you aren't using an
0:23
application you're simply using the
0:25
operating system and the device driver
0:27
as it's currently configured you might
0:29
also have a way to perform a test print
0:32
from the printer itself that will test
0:34
from the hardware of the printer and the
0:36
operating system and device driver have
0:39
no impact on the printer level test
0:42
here's an example of a Windows printer
0:44
test page this was created by pressing
0:46
that print test page button from the
0:49
device driver itself we're not only
0:51
interested in the quality of the output
0:53
but we're also interested in the
0:54
information that is contained on the
0:56
page we have information about the
0:57
printer properties and how they're
0:59
configured we also know the print driver
1:01
properties and we know exactly what
1:02
printer driver files are associated with
1:05
this
1:06
printer you may find that your printer
1:08
test page does not have the quality you
1:11
were expecting for example you might
1:12
have a single line that goes all the way
1:15
down the page if this is an inkjet
1:17
printer then you probably have dirty
1:18
print heads so simply cleaning those
1:20
print heads can probably remove that
1:22
line if this is a laser printer it's
1:25
probably a scratch that is on the
1:26
photosensitive drum that's used inside
1:28
of that printer and as the drum is
1:30
rotating around that scratch is simply
1:33
leaving a black mark all the way down
1:35
the page if the output is faded or it's
1:38
difficult to read what's on the page
1:40
then you're probably running out of
1:41
toner or you're very low on ink and if
1:44
you're seeing double images on the page
1:46
or there's speckling on the page then
1:49
the laser printer optical drum is
1:51
probably not cleaning properly and
1:52
you're seeing a ghost or shadow from the
1:55
previous rotation of that drum here's
1:58
what a scratch on that photosensitive
2:00
drum would look like it's just a single
2:02
black line that goes all the way down
2:04
the page and if the cleaning process is
2:06
not working properly then you're
2:08
probably seeing a normal part of the
2:10
page and then a copy of that that's a
2:13
little bit lighter later on down the
2:15
page this ghosting will continue until
2:17
you're able to correct the cleaning
2:19
problem inside of your laser printer
2:22
here's a page of output you definitely
2:24
don't want to see coming out of your
2:25
printer this garbled print might be
2:27
caused by a number of different issues
2:29
one of them might be a bad printer
2:31
driver or you've specified the wrong
2:33
model of printer in your Windows
2:35
configuration in those cases you might
2:37
be sending the wrong page description
2:39
language to the printer the printer
2:41
might be expecting PCL and you might be
2:43
sending Postcript or vice versa of
2:46
course we don't know if this is related
2:48
to the print driver or the operating
2:50
system or if we have a physical problem
2:52
with the printer so if you have a way to
2:54
print a test print on the printer you'll
2:57
be able to see if you're able to get
2:58
good output or if the printer also
3:00
provides this garbled output if your
3:03
printer test works properly and your
3:05
Windows driver test works properly then
3:08
it could be that the application is
3:10
sending bad information to the printer
3:12
you may want to try a different
3:13
application or try upgrading the
3:15
application you currently have to see if
3:17
you can improve the output
3:20
occasionally you'll find that the paper
3:22
will jam inside the printer what you
3:24
don't want to do is pull that paper so
3:26
that you're ripping it and leaving part
3:28
of that paper inside the printer
3:30
mechanism some printers will release
3:33
their printer mechanisms when you open
3:34
the top of the printer and that might
3:36
make it a lot easier to be able to
3:38
remove that paper if no paper is being
3:41
pulled from your printer tray or you're
3:42
getting multiple pages pulled at the
3:45
same time to go through the printer then
3:47
you might have a problem with either the
3:48
paper tray or with the pickup rollers
3:51
these pickup rollers need to be clean
3:53
and they do wear over time if you're
3:55
performing a printer maintenance using
3:57
an official maintenance kit from the
3:58
printer manufacturer they very often
4:01
will include additional pickup rollers
4:03
to avoid this kind of problem and
4:05
sometimes you'll notice that the output
4:07
from your printer especially with a
4:08
laser printer will have creases in the
4:11
paper itself that may be because of a
4:13
problem in the paper path as it's moving
4:15
through the printer or it may be that
4:17
you're using a paper that is a different
4:19
weight than what is recommended by the
4:21
printer manufacturer make sure you check
4:23
your printer documentation so you know
4:24
exactly what the recommended weight of
4:26
paper would be for that specific printer
4:29
here's a closer view of these pickup
4:31
rollers and the rollers inside of your
4:34
printer you can see that these are
4:35
relatively new they don't seem to have
4:37
any creases on them and you can see
4:39
there's not much wear on the rollers
4:41
that are currently
4:42
installed if your printer is not
4:44
printing but you look at the printer
4:46
queue and there's a lot of jobs that are
4:48
queued up waiting to be printed then
4:50
your problem might be with the printer
4:52
spooler itself the printer spooler is a
4:55
middle point between the application and
4:58
the printer the application sends a
5:00
print job to the spooler and the spooler
5:02
is responsible for then sending that
5:03
print job to the printer if one of those
5:06
print jobs is corrupted it may cause
5:08
this spooler to either crash or freeze
5:11
some print spoolers will restart
5:12
automatically for example this one in
5:14
Windows on the first failure will
5:17
restart this service the second failure
5:19
will restart again but if there is a
5:21
subsequent failure it will completely
5:23
stop and require your intervention you
5:26
may be able to go to your Windows event
5:28
viewer specifically the Windows print
5:30
service as part of that event viewer and
5:33
see if any of these corruptions or any
5:35
other problems with the print spooler
5:36
are occurring it may just be that one
5:39
print job is causing the issue for
5:41
everyone else but once that print
5:42
spooler fails nothing else in the queue
5:45
is going to be printed you as the
5:46
administrator are able to delete that
5:49
print job or move it to the bottom of
5:50
the list let everything else print and
5:53
then you can troubleshoot that specific
5:55
print
5:56
job our printers commonly make noises
5:59
but they're not usually a grinding noise
6:02
we don't really have to grind anything
6:03
up inside the printer to get it to print
6:05
properly instead this may indicate that
6:08
some other type of problem is occurring
6:10
maybe it's a paper jam inside the
6:12
printer or maybe an ink cartridge has
6:14
come loose or needs to be seated down so
6:16
that it doesn't rub against any other
6:18
parts of the printer each printer
6:21
operates in a different way and has a
6:22
different number of steps for
6:24
troubleshooting so make sure you check
6:25
the manual for your printer to see what
6:27
you should do if you happen to hear any
6:29
grinding noises or it may be a bad part
6:32
that requires a specialist to be able to
6:34
take the printer to their office or to
6:36
visit on site take the printer
6:38
completely apart find that bad part
6:41
replace it and then put everything back
6:43
together this could certainly cause some
6:45
noise inside the printer if you don't
6:47
properly seat those ink cartridges it
6:50
will certainly cause some noise when you
6:52
finally send a print job and that
6:54
carriage tries to go back and forth
6:55
inside of the printer our printers do
6:59
more than simply print information on a
7:01
page very often they are also providing
7:04
finishing services that finishing would
7:06
be collating binding stapling and
7:09
performing an additional task once the
7:11
output has been created some larger
7:13
printers will collate multiple copies
7:15
together and then staple each copy as
7:18
it's created occasionally you'll have a
7:20
staple jam and you'll need to remove
7:22
that staple to continue the process
7:24
every printer is a little bit
7:26
differently on how you remove those
7:27
staple jams so make sure you check with
7:29
your printer documentation and some
7:31
printers can perform hole punches that
7:33
hole punch is determined by the
7:35
application and the driver that you're
7:37
using so if the holes are not lining up
7:39
exactly where you would expect make sure
7:41
you check with the application that
7:43
you're using and make sure you're using
7:45
the latest print
7:46
driver on most printers we can choose to
7:49
print a portrait mode or a landscape
7:51
mode if you're printing a page in
7:53
portrait and you get the output in
7:56
landscape then there has definitely been
7:58
a mismatch somewhere along the line
8:01
normally this setting is handled in the
8:02
print driver of your operating system so
8:05
make sure you check the defaults for the
8:06
print driver and then also check the
8:09
settings that you're sending out when
8:10
you choose to print from your
8:12
application you may find that this is a
8:14
problem with the print driver and simply
8:16
upgrading the print driver will solve
8:18
the problem if the print driver is not
8:20
telling the printer the proper
8:21
orientation you may be able to control
8:24
this at the printer itself printers
8:26
usually have a default setting on
8:28
whether they will print in a portrait
8:29
mode or landscape mode and adjusting
8:31
that at the printer may affect all of
8:33
the subsequent output from that
8:36
device the printers that we use in our
8:38
offices tend to have multiple paper
8:40
trays you can see that on the printer
8:42
that we have here that on the bottom is
8:44
one two three four different paper trays
8:47
that you could select paper from when
8:49
you perform that output from your
8:50
application you would normally tell the
8:52
printer when you're sending the print
8:54
job that you would like all of the
8:55
output to come from the paper that is in
8:58
paper tray number one one of the things
9:00
you have to make sure is that the paper
9:02
tray that you're choosing matches the
9:04
size of the paper associated with the
9:06
output for example you don't want to
9:08
send output that was designed for a
9:10
14-in legal size page to a paper tray
9:13
that only has 11in letter size paper
9:16
you'll normally see the list of paper
9:18
trays in the print driver when you're
9:20
ready to print so you'll be able to
9:22
choose the proper tray from that list it
9:25
might be a good idea as the network
9:26
administrator to confirm that the list
9:29
of trays that you see in the print
9:30
driver matches the trays that are
9:32
physically installed on the printer if
9:34
there is a mismatch between the size of
9:36
the paper that you wanted to print and
9:38
the size of the paper that's in that
9:40
print tray you may see messages on the
9:42
screen of your printer that tell you
9:44
that this paper is mismatched and you'll
9:46
need to load the appropriate page for
9:49
this particular
9:50
output here's a view from the output
9:53
where I'm choosing to print to my laser
9:55
printer this says that the paper source
9:57
is the main tray and the media is
10:00
automatically selected but you might
10:02
want to configure your printer driver
10:04
with the specifics of what type of paper
10:06
are contained within that main tray so
10:09
here are the properties for this printer
10:11
driver and you can see that I have the
10:13
option to decide what a manual feed size
10:15
paper would be in this case on my
10:17
printer it's a letter size paper and
10:19
then you can specify what size of paper
10:21
is contained within the main tray and
10:24
you can see there are a number of
10:25
options available that you can configure
10:27
for that main tray of the
10:29
printer when you're troubleshooting
10:31
these corporate printers you also have
10:34
to be very good at troubleshooting
10:35
networks that's because these printers
10:37
tend to be connected to our wired and
10:40
our wireless networks we would want to
10:42
perform the same type of network
10:43
troubleshooting as we do for any other
10:45
device on the network you would first
10:48
need to confirm whether this is a
10:49
printer that's connected to the wired
10:51
network or the wireless network that way
10:53
you'll know whether you're
10:54
troubleshooting a problem with the cable
10:55
or whether you're troubleshooting a
10:57
problem with interference on the
10:58
wireless network you would then want to
11:00
confirm that the IP address settings of
11:02
the printer are configured properly for
11:04
that device so you want to check the IP
11:07
address the subnet mask the default
11:08
gateway any DNS settings and any other
11:12
important network configuration settings
11:14
and you may want to check to see if the
11:16
print server inside of this printer is
11:18
working properly most printers have
11:20
their own print server and there's
11:22
usually a management front end where you
11:24
can look at the print server stop it
11:26
restart it and perform any management of
11:28
the pending print jobs and because this
11:31
is a network device you can also look
11:33
for link lights for example on this
11:35
printer it has a connection on the back
11:37
of the printer and you can see if it's
11:39
connected to the network if it has an
11:40
active link and if it is sending and
11:42
receiving data
