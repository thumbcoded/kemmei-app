0:01
our laptops tablets and phones need a
0:04
battery to provide us with power when
0:06
we're moving from one place to another
0:08
unfortunately these batteries do not
0:10
last forever so if you're having
0:12
problems maintaining a charge in those
0:14
batteries it may be time to swap that
0:16
battery out for a new one you might also
0:18
find that your battery tends to lose its
0:21
charge rapidly this may not be because
0:23
the battery is old but instead it may be
0:26
because your device is using too much of
0:29
the battery this might be because your
0:31
mobile phone is in a bad reception area
0:33
so it's constantly checking to see if it
0:35
can find a good signal and be able to
0:38
use that as its primary connection
0:40
source this process of constantly
0:43
pulling for a signal can very rapidly
0:45
decrease the amount of power available
0:47
in your battery so you may want to turn
0:50
on airplane mode even when you're on the
0:53
ground especially if you're in one of
0:55
these areas where you have such bad
0:57
reception this might also be a good time
0:59
to disable any features that you aren't
1:01
using if you're not connected to an
1:03
802.11 network you might want to disable
1:06
that particular function and the same
1:08
thing applies to Bluetooth and GPS
1:10
signals many operating systems include
1:13
detailed statistics of how well the
1:15
battery is working and you can find
1:17
those both in iOS iPad OS and Android
1:20
under the settings option and then you
1:22
would choose battery this provides you
1:25
with extensive details about when the
1:27
battery was last charged what
1:29
applications may be using the most
1:31
amount of the battery and you can get
1:33
details about how healthy this battery
1:35
is and when it might be time to replace
1:37
it the batteries inside of our mobile
1:40
devices are very small and very thin
1:43
this is a good example of one but if
1:45
there is any problem with this battery
1:48
you'll find that it swells up into a
1:50
package of gas that's inside of this
1:53
container this also often distorts or
1:57
pops open the mobile device where this
1:59
battery happens to be inside because
2:01
there's no more room for that battery to
2:03
fit inside of that device these battery
2:06
containers are designed for this very
2:09
situation all of the gas inside of this
2:11
will be kept in that single container
2:14
and will not leak out this is something
2:16
you should not try to open or try to
2:18
pierce this is a significant fire risk
2:20
and you want to replace this as soon as
2:23
possible sometimes you'll find that the
2:26
battery is still working inside of this
2:28
device even when you see this buildup of
2:31
gas that has been accumulated you should
2:33
however not continue to use this battery
2:36
you should turn off this device and
2:38
replace this battery right away
2:41
unfortunately this battery bulging with
2:44
all of this gas can sometimes damage the
2:46
mobile device that it's contained in of
2:49
course that's much better than a fire or
2:51
some type of hazardous fumes being
2:53
released so we'll take that type of
2:55
swollen battery and damage to the mobile
2:57
device over something that might be much
2:59
worse
3:01
the displays on these mobile devices are
3:03
protected with a very strong sheet of
3:06
glass although this glass is hardened
3:08
and designed to be on these mobile
3:10
devices it can occasionally break if
3:12
that happens you'll need to replace the
3:14
display to be able to get this back into
3:16
working condition before you replace the
3:19
display it's always a good idea to back
3:22
up this system just in case a problem
3:24
occurs during the replacement
3:26
unfortunately there's no easy way to
3:29
just replace the glass very often the
3:31
glass is integrated into the display
3:33
itself so you will have to replace the
3:36
display to be able to replace the glass
3:39
keep in mind of course that this is
3:41
glass and because it's broken it can be
3:43
very sharp you don't want to use your
3:45
finger on this display because it's very
3:47
likely that you will cut your finger or
3:49
embed some glass within your finger
3:51
itself sometimes you can use a screen
3:54
protector to avoid any type of cuts or
3:57
you may want to use simply glass tape to
3:59
cover any part of the display that may
4:01
have some of these broken
4:03
pieces if you have a mobile device then
4:06
you're constantly aware of how often you
4:09
may need to charge that device
4:11
unfortunately you may run into a
4:13
situation where you're plugging
4:14
everything in to charge but the system
4:16
still is not charging the battery in
4:18
that case we'll want to check all of
4:20
those different components that we're
4:22
using for the charging process check the
4:24
charging cable itself and the interfaces
4:26
that we're connecting to on the mobile
4:28
device although there may be enough room
4:30
on the interface to plug in the power
4:32
source you may find that debris or other
4:35
things inside of that interface may
4:37
block the device from charging so make
4:40
sure you check inside of that connector
4:42
so that everything is clear and
4:44
unobstructed if you're very mobile then
4:47
your charging cable can tend to wear
4:49
over time and you may find that the
4:51
cable is simply got a short or is broken
4:53
in a place where it's not able to charge
4:56
your mobile device any longer you may
4:58
need to try a cable that you know is
5:00
working properly in another device to
5:01
see if the issue is with the interface
5:04
the mobile device or the cable that
5:06
you're using and if you're not sure if
5:08
the power adapter that you're using to
5:10
charge this with is working properly you
5:12
may want to use a multimeter you'll of
5:14
course want to check your outlet on the
5:15
wall and make sure that it's providing
5:17
power and then check the output from
5:19
your power adapter that it's providing
5:22
power to the cable the ability to take
5:25
your mobile device practically anywhere
5:27
and communicate with anyone else in the
5:29
world is a remarkable technology but it
5:32
does require that we have connectivity
5:34
to the network this wireless
5:36
connectivity can be hampered by a number
5:38
of different issues whether you're on a
5:40
Wi-Fi network or a cellular network on
5:43
your cellular network you want to check
5:44
that you're close enough to a tower to
5:46
be able to have enough signal strength
5:48
to be able to communicate back and forth
5:50
where you're located has a big impact on
5:53
how well you're able to communicate if
5:55
you're inside a building you may find
5:57
that stepping outside gives you the
5:58
signal you need to be able to complete
6:00
that communication wi-fi of course has a
6:03
very limited range so you'll need to be
6:05
somewhere near an access point to be
6:07
able to communicate on that network and
6:09
if there's anything else in the area
6:11
that's interfering with this Wi-Fi
6:12
network you may have problems
6:14
communicating to that access point if
6:17
there are a lot of access points in the
6:18
area especially in a very congested area
6:21
you might want to change your access
6:23
point to be a different channel or
6:25
different frequency and see if that
6:27
improves the communication between your
6:29
mobile device and the access point over
6:31
the Wi-Fi
6:33
network our mobile devices do not work
6:36
very well when there's liquid around
6:38
just a small amount of liquid or water
6:41
can destroy a mobile device inside of
6:44
our mobile devices are a small indicator
6:46
known as a liquid contact indicator or
6:49
LCI this is an indicator that changes
6:52
color anytime it's near liquid these are
6:55
often located inside of the charging
6:57
port or inside of your SIM port when
7:00
you're taking your phone in to be
7:02
repaired this is one of the first things
7:03
they check to see if your phone has been
7:05
subject to any type of liquid damage if
7:08
you have spilled liquid on your phone
7:10
the first thing you should do is power
7:12
it down and do not connect it to a power
7:14
source you want to remove it from any
7:16
case it happens to be in if if there are
7:18
any cards or batteries that you can
7:20
remove you'll want to take those out of
7:22
the phone as well and make sure that
7:24
it's able to get plenty of air so that
7:26
it can dry out you'll often hear people
7:29
taking a phone and putting it into a bag
7:31
of rice in reality putting a phone or
7:33
any other type of mobile device in a bag
7:35
of rice doesn't do very much for you the
7:38
idea is that the rice would be able to
7:40
pull that liquid and absorb it from the
7:42
phone making the inside of the phone dry
7:45
out that much faster in reality rice
7:48
doesn't absorb water very well instead
7:50
you'll want to use something like the
7:52
desicants that you might see when you
7:54
order a new piece of technology these
7:56
are these small packages that are inside
7:58
the box you can of course buy these
8:00
separately instead of putting rice in a
8:03
bag with the phone you might want to
8:04
take some desicant and put it in the bag
8:06
with the phone which will be a much
8:08
better way to absorb that
8:11
moisture if you do drop your phone in a
8:13
puddle and it turns off what you want to
8:16
do is ignore that phone for a day you
8:19
don't want to turn it on you don't want
8:20
to charge it don't connect it to a power
8:22
source don't heat it don't put it into
8:25
an oven don't move it around just leave
8:28
it in one place if you can put it into a
8:31
bag with some desicant that's probably
8:33
the best thing you can do one of the
8:35
things that is an advantage to rice is
8:38
that people are putting it in rice and
8:40
then leaving it alone for 24 hours
8:42
unfortunately the rice doesn't provide
8:44
any other advantages other than
8:46
isolating that device but occasionally
8:48
that's all you need is to have someone
8:50
not touch the phone for 24 hours if
8:53
after a day the phone appears to be dry
8:56
you can then try powering up the phone
8:58
and see if it will work hopefully that
9:00
power on process will work properly but
9:02
if it doesn't you may end up needing to
9:04
take the phone in for additional service
9:07
in normal operations our mobile phones
9:09
and tablets can get relatively hot there
9:12
are cooling systems within these phones
9:15
that can help passively cool them but if
9:17
you happen to have the phone in a very
9:19
warm area or you happen to leave it in
9:21
the sun you may find that the phone
9:23
turns itself off automatically in order
9:25
to preserve those electronics and if
9:28
you're in the sun and you're charging or
9:30
discharging the battery or using
9:32
applications that use a lot of CPU you
9:35
may find that the phone heats up very
9:37
very quickly you might be able to check
9:39
the apps that are running on your phone
9:41
your battery report will show you which
9:43
apps are using the most amount of
9:45
battery and then you can decide if
9:47
certain applications should be running
9:49
or not running in order to control the
9:51
temperature inside of that phone and if
9:54
at all possible you want to avoid
9:55
putting these mobile devices anywhere in
9:57
direct sunlight you certainly don't want
9:59
to put them on your dashboard or
10:01
anywhere else there might be an
10:03
excessive amount of heat
10:05
if you pick up your phone and you notice
10:07
the screen is completely black and then
10:10
you touch the screen and get no response
10:12
from it then we may need to reset this
10:15
device to see if we can regain control
10:17
on an Apple device you may be able to
10:19
press the power button slide to power it
10:21
off and then press the power button
10:23
again to turn the device back on some
10:25
iOS devices require you to hold down the
10:27
power button and some other button such
10:29
as the home or the volume button for 10
10:31
seconds and that will force a reset of
10:34
the device there are many different
10:36
manufacturers of Android devices so
10:38
there are many different ways to perform
10:40
this reset you may be able to simply
10:42
remove the battery put it back in and
10:43
power on the device or there may be a
10:46
series of keys such as a power button or
10:48
holding a power and a volume button
10:50
until the device resets different phones
10:53
have different combinations of keys to
10:55
do this reset so you want to check with
10:56
the documentation of your device to know
10:58
exactly what the reset process is for
11:01
your phone or your
11:02
tablet our mobile phones and mobile
11:05
devices are designed to be mobile so
11:07
they're designed to take a little bit of
11:09
abuse but they are not immune to any
11:12
type of damage and there may be times
11:13
when you find that certain interfaces or
11:16
parts of the device are damaged and
11:18
don't allow it to work properly for
11:20
example if you damage the USB interface
11:22
on the device you will not be able to
11:24
transfer any data to the device and you
11:26
certainly won't be able to charge it
11:28
this might be caused by roughly handling
11:31
the charging cable or simply using the
11:33
phone in a way that causes that
11:35
interface to be damaged your first clue
11:38
that you're having a problem is that the
11:40
device is either charging intermittently
11:42
or it's not charging at all you may have
11:44
to look at that interface very closely
11:46
to see if there's any damage and if
11:48
there is damage it may require that you
11:50
replace the entire system board on that
11:53
mobile device most of these interfaces
11:55
are not modular so it does require a
11:58
complete replacement of the system board
12:00
just to swap out that single interface
12:03
on the
12:04
phone whether you're on a desktop
12:06
computer a laptop computer or any type
12:09
of mobile device you should always be
12:11
concerned about malware there is malware
12:13
that will run on all of these platforms
12:15
and the malware developers would love to
12:18
infect your mobile device and use it for
12:20
their own purposes if your mobile device
12:23
has some unusual applications or large
12:25
amounts of data transfers or you notice
12:28
that one particular application is using
12:30
more CPU than it normally would that
12:33
might indicate that malware is embedded
12:35
in that particular device there's many
12:38
types of anti-malware and anti virus
12:40
software available for our mobile
12:42
devices you might want to run one just
12:44
to make sure that no one has put any
12:47
type of malicious software on your
12:49
mobile
12:50
phone if you're not touching your tablet
12:53
or your phone but you notice that
12:55
certain apps are activating themselves
12:57
or things are flashing on the screen as
12:59
if you are touching the device then you
13:01
may have a problem with cursor drift
13:03
this describes a device that is starting
13:05
up applications and moving things around
13:07
the screen even though no one is
13:10
directly interacting with that device
13:12
this is not something that's malicious
13:14
this is instead a bad display or a bad
13:17
digitizer on that device some older
13:19
devices have a calibration app that make
13:22
you touch different parts of the screen
13:24
so that it can figure out where the top
13:26
the middle and the bottom might be of
13:28
your display once you perform that
13:30
calibration you can usually solve any
13:32
issues of cursor drift but if this
13:35
continues you might have a hardware
13:36
issue and you may have to swap out the
13:39
entire
13:40
display maybe you've gone to the app
13:42
store you've picked out a new app that
13:44
you'd like to install but the app never
13:46
gets installed onto your device if this
13:49
is my device it's probably because
13:51
there's not enough available space you
13:53
want to check the storage capacity of
13:54
your device and if there are some
13:56
applications taking up more room than
13:58
necessary you might want to delete the
14:00
data or the application itself we also
14:03
have to keep in mind that all of these
14:04
applications are being downloaded from a
14:06
central source across the network if
14:09
this is a very large application then
14:11
you'll need plenty of bandwidth and
14:13
connectivity to be able to make that
14:15
happen and if your network connection is
14:17
less than optimal you may not be able to
14:19
install the app at this time you also
14:22
want to check that the app you're
14:23
installing is compatible with the device
14:25
that you're using many app stores will
14:28
do this automatically but it's always a
14:30
good idea to double check that the app
14:32
that you're running on your device is
14:34
compatible with the device and the
14:36
operating system version that you're
14:37
running and many of these app stores
14:39
require you to authenticate before you
14:41
can ever download so even if you select
14:44
an app you may still need to add a
14:46
username a password and any other
14:48
credentials to be able to finally
14:50
download that
14:52
application the stylus technology that
14:54
we use today on our phones and our
14:56
tablets is remarkable we can get very
14:58
granular control of the information on
15:00
the screen by using one of these
15:02
wireless external stylus many of these
15:05
stylus are active that means they
15:07
require power to be able to interact
15:09
with your device and there is a battery
15:12
inside of this that needs to be charged
15:14
and if your stylus isn't working make
15:16
sure you check the status of the battery
15:18
it may just need to be recharged many of
15:20
these also communicate over Bluetooth
15:23
and you'll want to check the Bluetooth
15:24
settings in your mobile device and make
15:26
sure that that stylus is paired with
15:28
your tablet or your mobile phone if it
15:30
isn't you can go through the Bluetooth
15:32
pairing process so that you can finally
15:34
use that stylus with your mobile device
15:37
like any other mobile device that we
15:39
take from place to place it's very
15:41
possible to damage that stylus the
15:43
stylus itself can be damaged so make
15:45
sure you look it over for any type of
15:47
physical problem and the tip on the
15:49
stylus may also be damaged fortunately
15:52
you can often buy replacement tips for a
15:54
stylus and be able to swap those out
15:56
relatively easy and if none of these
15:59
happen to work you may want to reset
16:01
your mobile device and if you can reset
16:03
the stylus as well and have everything
16:06
start from the very beginning very often
16:08
powering it off and powering it back on
16:10
again solves a number of problems that
16:12
you can't solve
16:14
otherwise and there might be times when
16:16
your mobile device is simply not
16:18
performing the way you would hope it may
16:20
be running very slowly or perhaps
16:22
stuttering anytime it tries to show any
16:24
video one of the first things to try
16:26
might be to update the software that's
16:28
running on that mobile device check the
16:31
operating system of the device itself
16:33
and the apps that you're using and make
16:35
sure you're using the latest versions on
16:37
this machine we also need storage on the
16:40
device to be able to swap things in and
16:42
out or to store our documents so make
16:44
sure you check the status of the storage
16:46
on this device and that you're not
16:47
running out of room you may see the
16:49
device slow down or simply restart
16:52
because you don't have enough storage
16:53
space on that phone this could also be
16:56
related to bad hardware especially if
16:58
the storage components of that device
17:00
are damaged it may take longer to write
17:03
information to storage or read
17:04
information from that storage that's why
17:07
it might seem like the problem is with
17:08
the application but in reality it's with
17:11
the hardware of your tablet or your
17:12
mobile phone or perhaps you have an
17:15
application running in the background
17:17
that's using an excessive amount of CPU
17:19
cycles or of memory make sure you check
17:22
the apps that are currently running on
17:23
your device and you might want to close
17:25
anything that's not currently being used
17:28
and sometimes you may be using a device
17:30
that's simply too old to run the latest
17:32
applications in those cases there's not
17:35
much you can do other than to upgrade
17:37
your phone your tablet or any other
17:39
mobile device that might be outdated
