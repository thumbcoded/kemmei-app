as you're most likely aware when you
0:03
turn on your computer there are a series
0:05
of tests that take place known as the
0:07
post this stands for power on self test
0:11
this is a self test to determine if the
0:13
core components of your system are
0:15
installed and if they're operational
0:17
this checks to see if your CPU is
0:19
installed and operational and if it's
0:21
able to communicate to your BIOS
0:23
hardware this might also check to see if
0:25
your video subsystem is working properly
0:27
and if memory is also installed in your
0:30
computer if there are any problems with
0:32
any of these components you'll get an
0:35
error message on the screen if possible
0:37
and a series of beeps that come from the
0:39
motherboard that beeps and the messages
0:42
that you might see on the screen might
0:44
be similar between manufacturers but
0:46
very often there are differences between
0:48
one manufacturer's BIOS and another this
0:51
means that a series of beeps on one
0:53
motherboard might mean something
0:55
completely different on another
0:57
motherboard for that reason you
0:59
shouldn't bother memorizing specific
1:01
beep codes for an individual
1:03
manufacturer because when this happens
1:05
you'll probably be referencing the
1:06
documentation anyway and since all of
1:09
these different manufacturers are using
1:11
different beep codes on different
1:12
motherboards it's probably a good idea
1:14
to check with the documentation anyway
1:17
the real key is understanding what that
1:19
beep code means and what you should do
1:21
next and if you are getting beep codes
1:24
there should be messages on the screen
1:25
if there's no problems with your video
1:27
display and certainly there will be a
1:29
series of codes probably long and short
1:32
codes that you'll need to reference
1:34
you'll need to look at the error codes
1:35
on your screen and reference how many
1:37
beeps you're hearing in this beep code
1:40
against the manufacturer's documentation
1:42
that's going to tell you what part of
1:44
this BIOS failed and hopefully point you
1:46
in a direction for resolving this
1:48
hardware
1:49
problem if you turn on your computer and
1:52
start hearing beeping noises but you see
1:54
nothing on the screen then your problem
1:57
is probably related to bad video on the
1:59
motherboard although it could be related
2:01
to bad memory or a bad CPU if any of
2:04
those components aren't working then you
2:06
probably have no way to present any data
2:09
on your screen and therefore the screen
2:11
remains black this could also be a
2:13
misconfiguration with the video
2:15
subsystem inside your BIOS so you'll
2:17
want to look at the BIOS configuration
2:19
and confirm that everything in the BIOS
2:21
looks to be in order if you're powering
2:23
up and you get a message that the BIOS
2:25
time and date is incorrect then it's
2:28
very possible your problem is with the
2:30
battery that's on the motherboard one of
2:32
the few reasons we still have a battery
2:34
on the motherboard is to maintain the
2:36
date and time especially if there's no
2:38
power source to the computer this means
2:40
we could move the computer plug it back
2:42
into a power source and the computer
2:44
already knows the date and time based on
2:47
that clock that's keeping that updated
2:49
when you're not connected to power if
2:51
your battery is failed you'll be
2:52
prompted to input the date and the time
2:55
each time you plug in that computer and
2:57
start it back up again simply replacing
3:00
the battery on the motherboard will
3:01
resolve this problem you can put in the
3:04
correct date and time and you'll no
3:05
longer be prompted each time you turn on
3:07
your computer and you may find when you
3:10
start your computer that it tries to
3:12
start an operating system from a USB key
3:15
that you installed into the computer
3:17
this may not be the boot process you
3:19
would like to have in place when the
3:21
computer starts so you might want to
3:23
look at your BIOS and see what the boot
3:25
order happens to be for example you may
3:27
be able to set the USB connection at a
3:30
lower priority than your internal SSD to
3:33
ensure that that SSD drive is always
3:35
referenced first during the boot process
3:38
you'll obviously need a valid operating
3:39
system on whatever device you decide to
3:41
boot from so if it's an SSD or a flash
3:44
drive you'll need an operating system so
3:46
that you can start from those individual
3:48
storage devices and your BIOS might give
3:51
you the option to check that there is
3:53
actually media plugged into that
3:54
particular startup device if there's
3:56
nothing physically connected to those
3:58
USB interfaces then your BIOS will
4:00
decide to go to the next device on its
4:03
list of boot
4:04
devices when you're working on your
4:06
computer it's important to know what to
4:08
do next when you run into a problem
4:10
because your issues might be bigger than
4:13
you were expecting whenever you see an
4:15
error like this you know that the entire
4:17
system has come to a stop it might tell
4:19
you that your device ran into a problem
4:21
and now needs to restart it also says
4:24
it's collecting some error info and then
4:26
the system in many cases will
4:28
automatically restart for you this
4:30
message is referred to as a Windows stop
4:33
error and it's the kind of message you
4:34
see when the operating system is not
4:37
able to recover from some type of issue
4:40
sometimes you'll see people refer to
4:41
this as the blue screen of death because
4:43
if you see this message you will need to
4:46
restart your computer and if you haven't
4:48
saved any of your work you may lose
4:50
everything that you've been working on
4:52
this message is telling you there's been
4:54
an irrecoverable error in the operating
4:56
system and the system had to be stopped
4:59
before something really bad happened
5:01
this is Windows attempting to maintain
5:03
the integrity of your operating system
5:05
and all of the data that's on it if you
5:08
start seeing these messages then there's
5:09
something that's going very wrong on
5:11
your system and you may want to continue
5:13
troubleshooting what could be causing
5:15
these stop errors to occur let's dive a
5:18
little deeper into some specific
5:20
hardware issues and see what the
5:22
symptoms are for each one if you're
5:24
having problems with your hard drive or
5:26
SSD then you might see messages like
5:29
cannot read from the source disc or you
5:31
might see very slow performance when
5:33
reading or writing to that drive with
5:35
hard drives you may even hear loud
5:37
clicking noises that indicate the disk
5:39
is constantly trying to retry reads or
5:42
writes to that storage device if you're
5:44
having memory problems you may see
5:46
application crashes blue screens of
5:48
death or parity errors being displayed
5:51
on your screen CPU problems might show
5:54
themselves as lock ups during intensive
5:56
processing or if your CPU is overheating
5:59
you may see spontaneous reboots or blue
6:02
screens as the system tries to protect
6:04
itself from damage power problems can
6:07
show up as intermittent problems where
6:09
the system might power on and then
6:11
immediately power off or you may find
6:13
that your system powers on but nothing
6:15
happens no fans are spinning no lights
6:18
are coming on and obviously no video is
6:20
appearing on the screen if there are
6:22
hardware problems with your video card
6:24
you may see blue screens artifact a on
6:26
your display or your entire system might
6:29
lock up when you're performing any
6:31
graphics intensive processes like
6:33
playing games or watching video motherboard
6:36
problems can show up as a lot of
6:38
different symptoms the motherboard is
6:40
the one thing that connects all of the
6:42
other components together so any
6:44
problems with the motherboard can show
6:46
up as problems with any of the other
6:47
components that are connected to it you
6:50
may see intermittent operation where
6:52
sometimes things work and sometimes they
6:54
don't or you may find that certain
6:56
expansion slots or certain connectors on
6:58
your motherboard are simply not
7:00
operational at all
7:02
let's look at a specific troubleshooting
7:04
process for when you turn on a computer
7:06
and nothing appears on your screen and
7:08
you don't hear any beeps this is a
7:10
common issue and usually tells us that
7:12
we either have a bad power supply or a
7:15
bad motherboard but it could be related
7:17
to any number of different problems our
7:19
first step when we see this is to check
7:21
if the computer is plugged in and see if
7:23
the power switch is actually turned on
7:25
this may sound very basic but it's
7:27
amazing how often somebody has forgotten
7:30
to plug in their computer or they
7:31
plugged it into a power strip that is
7:33
currently turned off sometimes there are
7:36
two power switches you may have a power
7:38
switch on the back of the computer near
7:40
the power supply and then there's the
7:42
normal power switch on the front if that
7:44
back power switch is in the off position
7:46
then the front power switch will not
7:48
work once you confirm the power is
7:50
working the next thing to check is if
7:52
there are any lights on the power supply
7:54
or on the motherboard most power
7:56
supplies have an LED that is on whenever
7:59
the power supply has power even if the
8:01
computer is turned off so if that LED
8:03
light is on you know that the power
8:05
supply is getting at least some power if
8:08
there's no LED on the power supply you
8:10
might want to check the motherboard to
8:12
see if there are any LED lights there if
8:14
you don't see any lights at all on the
8:16
system it's very likely that the power
8:18
supply has failed or perhaps the
8:20
motherboard is not receiving any power
8:22
from the power supply if you do see
8:24
lights when the system is powered on but
8:26
you're not hearing any fans or there's
8:28
no video on the display then you might
8:30
want to make sure that all of the
8:31
internal power cables are connected
8:33
properly check that the motherboard
8:35
power is connected check that the CPU
8:37
power is connected and make sure all of
8:39
the device power is connected as well if
8:42
you still don't see any video on the
8:44
screen it's time to start removing
8:46
components and try to narrow down which
8:48
part of the system may be causing the
8:50
problem start by removing all of the
8:52
expansion cards and peripherals that you
8:54
can remember you want to boot the system
8:56
with the minimum number of components
8:58
required start with just your motherboard
9:00
CPU one stick of memory and see if the
9:04
system will at least try to boot if it
9:06
does then you can add one component at a
9:08
time to see which one is causing the
9:10
problem if the system still doesn't boot
9:13
with the minimum number of components
9:15
then you may have a bad CPU bad memory
9:18
or a bad motherboard try putting a
9:20
different memory stick in to see if that
9:22
resolves the issue if you have a way to
9:24
try a different CPU then certainly do
9:26
that as well and of course if the
9:28
motherboard is the problem you'll need
9:29
to replace the entire motherboard which
9:31
unfortunately means removing many of the
9:33
other components and reinstalling them
9:35
into the new motherboard
9:37
CPU problems can be particularly
9:40
challenging because our modern CPUs
9:42
operate at very high speeds and
9:44
therefore they get very hot to cool
9:46
these CPUs down we commonly have a
9:48
cooling fan and a heat sink that are
9:50
connected directly to the top of the CPU
9:53
if for any reason that cooling process
9:55
is not working then the CPU will get
9:57
very hot very quickly the CPU is
10:00
designed with thermal protections and if
10:02
the CPU gets too hot it will either
10:04
throttle down the clock speed so it's
10:06
running much more slowly or if it
10:08
continues to get hotter the entire
10:10
system will suddenly power off this is
10:12
the CPU protecting itself from permanent
10:15
damage due to heat if your CPU is
10:17
overheating and shutting down the system
10:19
you want to confirm that the cooling fan
10:21
is working properly and that there's
10:23
good air flow through your computer case
10:25
check to see that the heat sink is
10:27
properly connected to the CPU that there
10:30
is thermal paste between the CPU and the
10:32
heat sink and that the heat sink is not
10:34
blocked with dust or other debris you
10:37
should also check the temperature
10:39
monitoring software to see what
10:40
temperatures you're getting for that CPU
10:42
under normal load you may also find that
10:45
the CPU is not properly seated in the
10:47
motherboard socket this might show up as
10:49
the system powering on but then getting
10:51
a blue screen of death or having the
10:53
system lock up randomly during
10:55
operation once you removed the CPU you
10:58
can visually check both the CPU and the
11:00
motherboard socket to confirm that all
11:02
of the connectors are straight and there
11:04
are no bent pins with modern Intel
11:06
processors the pins are in the
11:08
motherboard socket with AMD processors
11:11
the pins are on the CPU itself in either
11:14
case if any of those pins are bent it
11:16
can cause intermittent problems or the
11:18
CPU to not work at all there are
11:21
techniques to straighten bent pins but
11:23
this is a delicate process and very
11:25
often if the pins are bent the safest
11:27
option is to simply replace that CPU or
11:30
the motherboard if the pins happen to be
11:32
on the motherboard socket
11:34
one of the most important components in
11:36
our computers is the memory because
11:38
that's where all of our applications and
11:40
our data is temporarily stored and if
11:42
there are problems with the memory you
11:44
might see very random issues when you're
11:46
using your computer you might find that
11:48
applications crash randomly that there
11:50
might be blue screens of death that
11:52
occur at seemingly random times or you
11:55
might see parity errors on your screen
11:57
another symptom of bad memory is that
12:00
your system memory is not adding up to
12:02
the amount of memory that you have
12:04
installed for example if you have
12:06
installed 16 gigabytes of RAM but your
12:08
system is only showing 12 gigabytes then
12:11
you either have a piece of memory that's
12:13
not working or not installed properly or
12:15
there might be a problem with the memory
12:17
slot that's on your motherboard
12:19
fortunately there are memory diagnostic
12:21
utilities that can check your memory
12:23
extensively and they can tell you if any
12:25
of the memory that's in your system has
12:27
any problems one is the Windows memory
12:30
diagnostic that's built into Windows if
12:32
you have problems with your memory this
12:33
diagnostic will restart your computer
12:35
and run a series of memory tests if
12:38
there are problems found with your
12:39
memory it will give you a message after
12:41
the computer reboots if your Windows
12:43
memory diagnostic doesn't find any
12:45
problems but you're still having
12:47
intermittent memory issues you may want
12:49
to try a third-party memory testing
12:51
utility mem test 86 is one that is very
12:54
popular for this the nice thing about
12:56
mem test 86 is that it runs independent
12:59
of any operating system which means it
13:01
can test 100% of the memory that's in
13:03
your system this application runs from a
13:06
bootable USB drive or a bootable optical
13:09
disc and it will spend as much time as
13:11
you would like testing every aspect of
13:13
the memory to make sure that the memory
13:15
is working properly if you run the
13:17
memory test and you do find that you
13:19
have a memory issue you'll need to
13:20
determine which piece of memory is
13:22
having the problem if you have multiple
13:24
memory modules try removing one module
13:26
at a time and running the memory test
13:28
again once you've isolated which module
13:30
is having the problem you can replace
13:32
that individual memory module and the
13:34
rest of the memory in your system should
13:36
continue to work normally you should
13:38
also check the motherboard documentation
13:40
to see if there are any specific memory
13:42
configurations that are recommended for
13:44
your particular motherboard for example
13:46
some motherboards might require that you
13:48
populate memory slots in a particular
13:50
order or you may only be able to use
13:52
certain types of memory modules that are
13:54
specifically designed for your system
13:57
your computer's power supply must
13:59
provide the right voltage to all of the
14:01
components that are in your computer
14:03
although our power supplies are
14:05
generally very reliable there can be
14:06
situations where certain voltages may
14:09
not be correct and that might cause
14:11
problems with the components that are
14:12
using those voltages if you're having
14:15
problems with your power supply you
14:16
might see the system not powering on at
14:19
all it might power on and then
14:21
immediately power back off or you might
14:23
have intermittent problems where the
14:25
system randomly powers off and then
14:27
powers back on you might also have
14:29
messages from the motherboard or from
14:30
software that tells you that the power
14:32
supply voltages are not within normal
14:35
tolerances some systems will
14:37
automatically shut down if the power
14:39
supply voltages are outside of those
14:41
normal tolerances to prevent any damage
14:43
to the system components one way to
14:45
check the power supply is to see if the
14:47
power supply fan is working this is
14:49
commonly visible from the back of the
14:51
computer if that fan is not spinning you
14:53
may have a power supply that is not
14:55
working you might also check to see if
14:57
there is an LED on the power supply or
14:59
the motherboard that would indicate the
15:01
power supply is providing at least some
15:03
electricity to the system if you have a
15:05
multimeter you can also check the
15:07
voltages that are being provided by the
15:08
power supply this obviously requires
15:11
that you're comfortable working inside
15:12
the computer and you understand how to
15:14
safely use a multimeter around these
15:16
voltages the motherboard power
15:18
connection usually carries a number of
15:20
different voltages and you can measure
15:22
those voltages to see if they're within
15:23
normal tolerances most motherboards
15:26
expect to see 12 volts 5 volts and 3.3
15:30
volts from the power supply it's also
15:33
very common to have separate power
15:34
connections for the CPU and those
15:36
usually run at 12 volts as well if any
15:39
of these voltages are significantly
15:41
outside of normal ranges it could cause
15:43
stability problems in your system
15:46
our modern motherboards are very
15:48
complicated with many different
15:50
components and subsystems all working
15:52
together unfortunately if any part of
15:54
the motherboard has a problem it can
15:56
affect the rest of the system this means
15:58
that motherboard problems can show up as
16:00
many different types of issues you might
16:03
have expansion slots that don't work you
16:05
might have USB ports or other connectors
16:07
that are not operational or you might
16:09
see very intermittent problems where
16:11
things work sometimes and they don't
16:13
work other times this is why
16:15
troubleshooting motherboard problems can
16:17
be so challenging sometimes the only way
16:20
to know if the motherboard is the
16:21
problem is through a process of
16:23
elimination we would swap out the CPU
16:25
try different memory replace the power
16:28
supply and ultimately if none of those
16:30
things resolve the issue then it's
16:32
probably the motherboard that's causing
16:33
the problem the other challenge with
16:36
motherboard problems is that replacing
16:38
the motherboard is a significant
16:39
undertaking you effectively need to
16:42
remove every component from the
16:43
motherboard and then reinstall all of
16:45
those components into a brand new
16:47
motherboard if you have a warranty on
16:49
your computer then it would probably be
16:51
worthwhile to have the manufacturer
16:53
replace that motherboard instead of
16:54
doing it yourself 
16:56
if you've ever worked with a computer
16:58
that had video problems you know that
17:00
the symptoms can be quite dramatic you
17:02
might see artifacts on your screen
17:04
incorrect colors or your screen might be
17:07
flickering or distorted you might also
17:09
have your system lock up completely when
17:11
you're trying to perform graphics
17:13
intensive tasks like gaming or watching
17:15
high-definition video another common
17:17
symptom of video problems is to see a
17:20
blue screen of death especially when
17:22
you're in the middle of using a graphics
17:24
intensive application if you're having
17:26
any of these video problems the first
17:28
thing you should do is make sure that
17:29
your video drivers are up to date video
17:32
drivers are updated very frequently and
17:34
it's very common to have video problems
17:36
that are resolved simply by upgrading to
17:38
the latest version of your video driver
17:40
if updating your video drivers doesn't
17:42
resolve the problem then you might want
17:44
to check the temperature of your video
17:45
card modern graphics cards can get very
17:48
hot especially if you're doing graphics
17:50
intensive work you want to make sure
17:52
that the cooling fan on the graphics
17:54
card is working and that the heat sink
17:55
is not blocked with dust or other debris
17:58
if the graphics card continues to
18:00
overheat it will either throttle down
18:02
the graphics performance or the entire
18:04
system may blue screen and restart to
18:06
protect the graphics card from permanent
18:08
damage if the graphics problems persist
18:11
you may want to try moving the graphics
18:13
card to a different expansion slot on
18:15
your motherboard to see if the problem
18:17
is with the slot itself or with the
18:19
graphics card alternatively you could
18:21
try a known good graphics card in that
18:23
same slot to determine if the problem is
18:25
with the slot or the card
18:27
sometimes you'll power on your system
18:29
and nothing will appear on the screen
18:31
even though you can hear the fans
18:32
running and it seems like the computer
18:34
has power this could be a display
18:36
problem a graphics card problem or a
18:39
motherboard problem and the process for
18:41
troubleshooting this is very similar to
18:43
our other troubleshooting processes the
18:45
first thing to check is that all of the
18:47
cables are connected properly check the
18:49
power cable for the monitor and check
18:51
the video cable connection between your
18:53
computer and the monitor it's also
18:55
important to check if your monitor has
18:57
multiple input types if it has HDMI VGA
19:00
DVI and DisplayPort inputs you want to
19:03
make sure that you have the input
19:04
selector on the monitor set to match the
19:07
type of cable that you're using if all
19:09
of the cables are connected and the
19:11
monitor input is set correctly and
19:13
you're still not seeing any video you
19:15
may want to try the computer with a
19:17
different monitor or try moving your
19:19
monitor to a different computer to see
19:21
if the problem is with the monitor or
19:23
with the computer itself if the problem
19:25
is with the computer then you'll want to
19:27
continue troubleshooting the graphics
19:28
card the motherboard and other
19:30
components using our normal hardware
19:32
troubleshooting process
19:34
I mentioned earlier that one very
19:36
specific problem you might have with
19:38
computers is running out of storage
19:40
space and this is a problem that can
19:42
affect the performance of your entire
19:44
computer when your storage space is very
19:46
low the operating system doesn't have
19:48
room to store temporary files or expand
19:51
memory if it needs to you might see
19:53
messages telling you that the disk is
19:55
full or you might see very slow
19:57
performance especially when you're
19:59
trying to save files or load large
20:01
applications the obvious solution to
20:03
this problem is to free up some disk
20:05
space and there are a number of ways to
20:07
do this you could delete files that you
20:09
no longer need you could uninstall
20:11
applications that you're not using or
20:13
you could move files to external storage
20:15
or to cloud storage Windows includes a
20:18
disk cleanup utility that can help you
20:20
identify temporary files that can be
20:22
safely deleted and there are also
20:24
third-party utilities that can help you
20:26
identify large files that might be
20:27
taking up unnecessary space on your
20:29
system if freeing up disk space doesn't
20:32
solve your performance problems then you
20:34
might want to consider upgrading to a
20:36
larger storage device this could be a
20:38
larger hard drive or SSD and modern
20:41
storage devices have much more capacity
20:43
than older devices so you should be able
20:45
to find something that will meet your
20:47
storage needs for the foreseeable future
20:50
another hardware problem we commonly see
20:52
is when the computer becomes
20:54
unresponsive and it appears to lock up
20:56
completely you can't move the mouse
20:58
cursor the keyboard doesn't respond and
21:00
nothing seems to work this is often
21:02
called a system freeze or a system hang
21:05
and it can be caused by many different
21:07
issues if this happens very rarely then
21:10
it might just be a temporary software
21:12
problem and you can simply restart the
21:14
computer to resolve the issue but if
21:16
it's happening frequently then there's
21:18
probably a hardware problem that needs
21:20
to be resolved common causes of system
21:22
freezes include CPU overheating bad
21:25
memory faulty hard drives or power
21:28
supply problems to troubleshoot a system
21:30
freeze you'll want to use the same
21:32
process that we've been discussing check
21:34
the temperatures make sure the cooling
21:36
is working properly run memory tests and
21:39
check the power supply voltages you
21:41
might also want to check the event
21:42
viewer in Windows to see if there are
21:44
any error messages that might give you a
21:46
clue about what's causing the system to
21:48
freeze if you can't identify a specific
21:50
hardware component that's causing the
21:52
problem you might want to boot the
21:53
computer from external media like a USB
21:56
drive or optical disc to see if the
21:58
problem persists if the computer works
22:00
normally when booting from external
22:02
media then the problem is probably with
22:04
your internal storage device or the
22:06
operating system itself
22:08
one issue that can be particularly
22:10
frustrating is when the computer is very
22:12
slow to respond this might show up as
22:15
applications taking a very long time to
22:17
load the operating system taking a long
22:19
time to start up or just general
22:21
sluggish performance when you're using
22:23
the computer there are many potential
22:25
causes for this issue and it can be
22:27
hardware related or software related if
22:30
you're having performance issues the
22:32
first thing to check is if the computer
22:34
is running out of memory you can use the
22:36
task manager in Windows to see how much
22:38
memory is being used and how much is
22:40
available if you're using most or all of
22:42
your available memory then adding more
22:44
memory might improve the performance
22:46
significantly you should also check the
22:48
hard drive space as we discussed earlier
22:50
if the hard drive is nearly full it can
22:52
significantly slow down the system
22:54
another thing to check is the CPU
22:56
utilization again you can use the task
22:58
manager to see which processes are using
23:00
the most CPU resources if you see that
23:03
the CPU is consistently running at high
23:05
utilization there might be a process
23:07
that's not working properly or you might
23:09
need a faster CPU for the work that
23:11
you're doing you should also check for
23:13
any malware or viruses on the system
23:15
malware can significantly slow down a
23:17
computer and it's not always obvious
23:19
that malware is present run a full
23:21
system scan with your antivirus software
23:23
and consider using additional malware
23:25
scanning tools to make sure your system
23:27
is clean finally you might want to check
23:30
if there are any driver issues or
23:31
software conflicts that could be causing
23:33
performance problems outdated drivers or
23:36
incompatible software can cause
23:37
significant performance issues and
23:39
updating drivers or uninstalling
23:41
problematic software might resolve the
23:43
performance issues that you're seeing
23:46
sometimes the solutions to our hardware
23:48
problems require that we replace the
23:50
hardware we talked earlier about
23:52
starting your computer and having it
23:53
prompt for a date and time that's
23:56
because the battery that's on your
23:57
motherboard has failed and you'll need
23:59
to replace that battery so your system
24:01
can properly maintain the date and the
24:03
time these are usually button style
24:05
batteries they have a very low profile
24:07
on your motherboard so they don't take
24:09
up a lot of room they are usually very
24:11
easy to remove and replace and you can
24:13
generally find these at most stores if
24:16
you have an older computer you may find
24:18
that removing this battery completely
24:21
resets your BIOS configuration on most
24:24
modern computers however removing this
24:26
battery will not change any of the
24:28
configurations of your BIOS including
24:30
any passwords that have been set in the
24:32
BIOS if you need to remove or completely
24:35
reset your BIOS settings then you'll
24:37
probably need to use a jumper to be able
24:39
to do that rather than removing this
24:42
battery
