if you've ever turned on your computer
0:04
but your screen is black or gives a
0:06
message that says no signal then you'll
0:09
need to do a bit of troubleshooting to
0:11
determine why that's occurring One of
0:13
the first things you'll probably want to
0:15
try is also one of the most easiest You
0:17
want to find out if the monitor really
0:19
is connected properly You should check
0:21
to make sure that the video cable
0:23
between the computer and the monitor is
0:25
connected and that the connections are
0:27
pushed in completely You'll also want to
0:30
check the power for the monitor and make
0:32
sure that it's getting the proper amount
0:33
of power to be able to even turn on This
0:36
is a very common problem and although it
0:39
sounds almost patronizing to ask
0:40
somebody if the monitor is actually
0:43
plugged in you'll find that a great deal
0:45
of the time that's exactly what the
0:47
problem happens to be If all of those
0:50
cables are properly connected we can
0:52
move on to the next step which is to
0:54
check the input selection on the monitor
0:56
configuration There may be multiple
0:58
input types for this particular monitor
1:01
It may support HDMI and display port VGA
1:04
DVI and many multiples of those
1:07
connections Many monitors will
1:10
automatically determine where the signal
1:12
is coming in and they will switch
1:13
themselves automatically to that input
1:16
But not every monitor performs that
1:18
function So you want to check the
1:20
monitor configuration and make sure that
1:22
if you're plugging in an HDMI cable that
1:24
your monitor is configured to look for
1:26
signal from the HDMI port If you can see
1:30
a video signal but the screen is very
1:33
very dim your problem could be with the
1:35
brightness or the contrast Most monitors
1:38
have options to allow you to turn up and
1:40
turn down those values So it may be a
1:42
simple configuration setting to get that
1:44
brightness turned up so that you can see
1:46
the display And if nothing seems to help
1:49
this problem it could potentially be a
1:51
hardware problem with the monitor itself
1:54
So you may want to try moving this
1:55
monitor to another computer and see if
1:57
the problem still occurs Or you might
1:59
want to find a known good monitor and
2:01
plug into this computer And if you're
2:03
still having problems you know the issue
2:05
probably isn't with the monitor hardware
2:08
And you may be able to see information
2:10
on the screen when you're booting up
2:12
There may be BIOS messages that go by
2:14
You might even see a Windows splash
2:16
screen But as soon as that splash screen
2:18
disappears the screen remains black It
2:21
could be that the configuration settings
2:22
of the operating system are not set
2:24
properly for the type of monitor that
2:26
you're using So if you're booting into
2:28
Windows you may want to try the Windows
2:30
VGA mode which you access by pressing
2:33
the F8 key while the system is booting
2:35
up VGA mode is a generic mode that works
2:38
with practically any monitor So you know
2:41
running in VGA mode should be one that
2:43
is compatible with the monitor that
2:45
you're using
2:47
If you've ever been in a conference room
2:48
you've probably seen these LCD
2:50
projectors that are hanging from the
2:52
ceiling or sitting on the table And
2:54
you'll notice that they give a very
2:56
bright display They're able to do this
2:58
because inside of this very small device
3:01
is a very bright metal halli bulb That
3:04
bulb gets very very hot because it is
3:07
putting out a lot of light If you were
3:09
to measure it it gets around 1,000Â° C
3:13
inside of that bulb Because these bulbs
3:16
get so hot you'll notice that these
3:18
projectors have fans inside that are
3:20
constantly running There are also
3:22
temperature sensors inside of these
3:24
projectors And if they get too hot the
3:26
projector will shut down to avoid
3:28
damaging that bulb And if you gracefully
3:31
power down this projector you'll notice
3:33
that even though the light turns off the
3:35
fan will continue to run for a number of
3:37
minutes That's because the projector is
3:40
slowly cooling off that bulb to help
3:42
prevent it from having any damage to the
3:44
bulb itself These bulbs are relatively
3:47
expensive So this entire process of
3:49
cooling the bulb is to make sure that we
3:51
don't damage the bulb and that the bulb
3:53
stays active and working as long as
3:55
possible With enough use however these
3:58
bulbs will eventually fail and you'll
4:00
need to swap the bulbs out On many of
4:02
these projectors it's a relatively
4:04
modular process They're designed for the
4:07
enduser to be able to open up the
4:09
projector take out the old bulb and
4:11
replace it with a new bulb If someone is
4:14
going through the process of replacing
4:16
the bulb especially if these projectors
4:18
are ceiling mounted you might want to
4:20
spend some time cleaning all of the dust
4:22
and replacing the air filters inside of
4:25
these systems This will ensure that you
4:27
have plenty of cool air that is able to
4:29
be pulled through this projector and is
4:31
able to keep that bulb as cool as
4:33
possible
4:34
One of the things you'll notice about
4:36
LCD display specifications is they tell
4:40
you exactly what the horizontal pixels
4:42
and vertical pixels are for that display
4:45
That's because those pixels never change
4:47
You will always have that number of
4:49
pixels in the horizontal and you will
4:51
always have that number of pixels in the
4:53
vertical We refer to these numbers of
4:55
pixels on the display as the native
4:58
resolution And if you want this display
5:00
to be as crisp and clear as possible you
5:03
will want to match that native
5:04
resolution in the video settings of your
5:06
operating system If you set your
5:08
computer's video output to be different
5:11
than the native resolution of the
5:13
display it will try to adjust the screen
5:16
to fit into the resolution that you
5:18
specified But one of the things you'll
5:20
notice is that the text and the graphics
5:22
will not be as crisp as you might expect
5:25
This graphic shows us what the monitor
5:27
looks like when you set the operating
5:29
system to a resolution that is not
5:31
compatible with that native resolution
5:33
of the display You'll notice that some
5:35
of the text is trying to adjust to that
5:38
different size by expanding and
5:40
contracting the size of the letters And
5:43
if you look at this overall on the
5:44
display it is certainly not as crisp and
5:47
clear as if you had selected the native
5:49
resolution If this is what your display
5:52
looks like you may want to try changing
5:53
the display resolution in your operating
5:55
system If you don't want to use the
5:57
native resolution of the monitor you
6:00
could try a multiple of that native
6:02
resolution to get the best possible
6:04
output on that display screen
6:07
If you ever look at a monitor that is
6:09
always on and always displaying the same
6:12
type of information you'll start to see
6:14
information that is still on the screen
6:17
even though the other information on the
6:19
screen has already changed You may see
6:21
some ghosting or some background colors
6:24
from information that previously used to
6:26
be shown on that particular display We
6:29
refer to this ghosting of information
6:31
that is no longer being shown as burn-in
6:34
That's because the information that was
6:35
displayed on the screen has been there
6:38
for an extended period of time Many
6:40
monitors will try to prevent this from
6:42
occurring by examining the information
6:44
that's being displayed on the screen And
6:46
if the monitor notices that not much on
6:49
the screen is changing it will slightly
6:52
shift the image on the screen a few
6:54
pixels in one direction or another This
6:56
is in the hopes that it's able to move
6:59
the monitor just enough to prevent any
7:01
type of burn-in but not move the picture
7:03
enough that you might notice You may see
7:06
this mentioned in the monitor
7:07
configuration as pixel shift and you may
7:10
want to make sure that that is turned on
7:12
for your monitor This was a much larger
7:15
issue on the older style CRTs or cathode
7:18
ray tubes but these days even LCD
7:21
monitors have this particular issue On
7:23
LCD monitors you may hear this referred
7:25
to as image sticking And it might be
7:27
possible to remove that image from the
7:30
screen by putting a different image on
7:33
the screen for an extended period For
7:35
example you might want to display a
7:36
white screen overnight just to see if
7:39
you can remove that image sticking from
7:41
your LCD monitor Here's another view of
7:44
this burn-in or image sticking on a
7:47
monitor You'll notice right at the top
7:49
the screen used to say departures Now it
7:51
says departures all airlines We know
7:54
that it used to say departures because
7:56
you can almost read the word departures
7:59
that has been ghosted into the screen at
8:01
the very top And we can see similar
8:03
problems with colors and other text
8:05
that's on this screen because it's been
8:07
displaying similar information over such
8:09
an extended period of
8:11
time These LCD displays consist of
8:14
millions of pixels So it is possible
8:17
that one of those pixels might go bad
8:20
When that occurs you have a dead pixel
8:22
which means that you have a pixel on the
8:24
screen that is always going to be black
8:27
This is probably a manufacturing defect
8:29
and it's unlikely that you would be able
8:31
to remove that dead pixel by replacing a
8:34
cable or changing a display setting
8:36
Before you call the manufacturer to swap
8:38
out this monitor though you might want
8:40
to be sure that it really is a dead
8:42
pixel So make sure that the screen is
8:44
clean and that you're not just seeing a
8:47
little bit of dirt that may have
8:48
attached itself to the outside of the
8:50
screen This is something you can't fix
8:53
inside of this monitor It's not possible
8:55
to undo a dead pixel once this pixel has
8:58
failed So to resolve the problems of a
9:00
dead pixel you'll need to replace the
9:03
entire display It might be that the dead
9:06
pixel is at the corner of the screen you
9:08
probably won't even see it and you may
9:10
be able to work with that But it seems
9:12
more often than not that that pixel is
9:14
somewhere that we always see it on the
9:16
screen and the only way to fix this is
9:19
to get a new
9:20
monitor There may be times when someone
9:22
is working on their computer they're
9:24
surfing the internet working on a
9:26
document and everything is looking fine
9:28
until suddenly the screen goes black and
9:31
then suddenly just as quickly everything
9:33
comes back In that particular case of a
9:35
flashing screen there are a number of
9:37
troubleshooting steps you can go through
9:39
to determine why this screen is flashing
9:42
One of the first things you'll want to
9:44
check is that the video cable
9:45
connections are tight and that the cable
9:47
itself is not loose or falling out of
9:49
any of those connectors Sometimes the
9:52
cable itself is faulty and if you swap
9:54
out the video cable you may be able to
9:56
resolve the issue The problem could be
9:59
within the monitor hardware itself So
10:01
you may want to try swapping this
10:03
monitor for a known good display and see
10:05
if the problem still occurs And you
10:07
might also want to look at the
10:08
configuration settings of your operating
10:10
system and that it is set to exactly the
10:13
make and model of the monitor that
10:15
you're using You might also want to look
10:17
at the display configurations of your
10:19
operating system and make sure that
10:21
those settings are compatible with the
10:23
specifications of your monitor
10:25
When you're using a monitor you expect
10:27
to have bright whites and colors that
10:30
are very vibrant But occasionally you
10:31
might get a monitor like this one where
10:33
the colors are not quite correct You'll
10:36
notice that they're either too blue or
10:38
too green and none of the color
10:40
representation matches what really
10:42
should be shown on this display The
10:45
monitor itself has settings where you
10:47
can define things like the tint There
10:49
may be custom color presets in the
10:51
monitor configuration and there may be a
10:54
button to factory reset all of these
10:56
settings so that you can take it back to
10:58
a known good configuration The operating
11:01
system also can set output controls for
11:04
the color So you may want to look at the
11:06
color tint inside of your display
11:08
settings and make sure that they are not
11:10
skewed in one direction or another Some
11:13
operating systems have a night mode or a
11:16
night light setting that dramatically
11:18
changes the colors on the screen For
11:20
example during the nighttime you may
11:21
notice that the screen has more of a
11:23
blue tint If you're someone who's doing
11:26
graphics design or video editing that
11:28
might cause problems when you're using
11:30
that device So check your night mode
11:32
settings inside of your operating system
11:34
and see if you can toggle those settings
11:37
on and off as you need them
11:40
Many monitors we use today are for more
11:42
than just video output Many of these
11:44
monitors have speakers inside of them
11:47
and we can use them as audio output as
11:49
well If you're having a problem getting
11:51
any sound out of the monitor or the
11:53
volume levels are very low you'll
11:55
probably want to do some troubleshooting
11:58
If the monitor has speakers then it
12:00
probably also has a volume control
12:02
setting So you may want to check that
12:03
volume control to see if it's turned
12:05
down or if someone may have muted the
12:07
speakers entirely We also might be
12:10
getting the audio input from a number of
12:12
different sources If the sound is being
12:14
received over the same cable that's
12:16
being used for video you might want to
12:18
look at your monitor configuration and
12:20
that the audio input matches the video
12:23
input So if you're using an HDMI
12:25
connection make sure that your sound is
12:28
also set for an HDMI input You might
12:31
also want to look at your operating
12:32
system and confirm that it's configured
12:34
to send audio out the HDMI port as well
12:38
Some monitors also have other
12:40
connections for audio For example your
12:42
monitor might have an analog audio input
12:45
This means you may have to configure the
12:47
monitor to accept video on HDMI and
12:50
accept audio on the analog audio
12:53
input If the monitor is difficult to see
12:56
it could simply be that the display
12:58
settings for brightness and contrast are
13:00
not set properly Most monitors will
13:03
allow you to set those brightness
13:05
controls and that should be the first
13:07
thing to check if you're having a
13:08
problem with a dim screen You might also
13:11
want to check your operating system
13:13
These days many operating systems are
13:14
set to modify the display output
13:17
depending on the time of day or how much
13:19
light is being received on that
13:21
particular computer So you might want to
13:23
check to see if there is an auto dimming
13:24
function in the operating system or if
13:27
you're running on a laptop and you
13:28
unplug from a power source it might
13:31
naturally dim the display on the laptop
13:33
just so you can conserve that much
13:35
battery And of course the driver
13:37
settings inside of that laptop or
13:39
desktop computer may have settings for
13:41
brightness as well If you've made
13:44
changes to these settings and the
13:46
display is still very dim the issue
13:48
could be with the backlight of the
13:50
display itself This might be very
13:53
obvious if part of the screen is very
13:55
bright and other parts of the screen are
13:57
very dark and you'll know that you've
13:58
had a partial failure of the backlight
14:01
In some cases you might be able to order
14:04
parts to replace in that monitor that
14:06
would enable the backlight again or
14:08
you'll have to replace the entire
14:11
monitor You've probably sat down at a
14:14
computer and noticed that the display is
14:16
not quite right There might be flashing
14:18
or flickering or there might be bars
14:21
that are extending across the screen
14:23
This might not be enough to completely
14:25
prevent us from working but it certainly
14:27
doesn't provide us with the best quality
14:29
display If this is an analog connection
14:32
you might want to look at the pins on
14:34
the connector and make sure that
14:35
everything is plugging in properly to
14:37
the interface You might also want to
14:39
check your operating system and see what
14:41
the geometry settings are for this
14:44
particular monitor and see if there
14:45
might be any settings for resolution
14:47
that might be more compatible with the
14:49
display A good rule of thumb is to set
14:52
your computer to match the native
14:54
display of the monitor to get the best
14:56
possible screen So you might want to
14:58
change the operating system at least
15:00
temporarily to see if making those
15:02
changes have any effect on the quality
15:04
of the screen And the issue may be
15:06
related to the cable So replacing the
15:08
cable might be an easy check to see if
15:10
that resolves this particular issue Some
15:13
video drivers support the ability to
15:15
enable or disable hardware acceleration
15:18
within the video card This hardware
15:20
acceleration is designed to give us the
15:22
fastest possible updates to the screen
15:25
which increase the overall quality of
15:27
the display output But this hardware
15:29
acceleration can also cause problems in
15:32
certain configurations So disabling the
15:34
hardware acceleration might improve the
15:36
overall quality of the
15:39
image It can sometimes be a challenge to
15:41
get a computer and a display to be
15:44
completely compatible with each other
15:46
Fortunately many operating systems will
15:48
recognize any differences and try to
15:50
adjust the image to give you the best
15:52
quality output But sometimes these
15:55
settings are disabled and you might get
15:57
something like this where the display
15:58
itself is very small on a screen that is
16:01
much larger Inside your operating system
16:04
is probably a display setting for
16:06
scaling And if you enable scaling on
16:08
that system it will expand the image so
16:11
that it fits the entire height and width
16:13
of the monitor that you're using
16:16
Another sizing issue you might run into
16:18
is when you have a very highresolution
16:20
monitor and you're running your
16:22
operating system at the native
16:23
resolution of that monitor This commonly
16:26
results in tiny little icons that are on
16:29
the screen and text that is very
16:31
difficult to read But there are
16:33
configuration settings that allow you to
16:35
change the scaling of the operating
16:37
system so that you can keep the same
16:39
resolution but simply increase the scale
16:42
of the text the apps and other items in
16:44
the operating system This means you can
16:47
start with a scaling of 100% where you
16:51
have a 4K display but very small icons
16:54
on the screen If you increase this to
16:56
200% then you may be able to work with
16:59
the user interface components much
17:01
easier And increasing to 300% allows you
17:04
to really read what's on the screen and
17:06
makes all of these user interface
17:08
components of the operating system work
17:10
at a level that is comfortable to the
17:12
end
17:13
user Sometimes you'll work with an LCD
17:16
display that has flickering or flashing
17:19
There may be blocks of information on
17:20
the screen or lines that are going
17:22
across the entire length of the screen
17:25
This makes it very difficult to see
17:27
what's on the screen and in some cases
17:29
makes it so that you can't see anything
17:30
that you're doing on that particular
17:32
display If it's an extensive problem
17:35
similar to the one that we see on the
17:36
screen here then it's probably a
17:38
hardware failure of the display These
17:41
liquid crystal displays are very easy to
17:43
break and you want to be sure that you
17:45
don't touch or put anything near that
17:47
LCD screen If you do run into this
17:50
problem then you'll probably need to
17:51
replace the entire display to resolve
17:54
this issue Before you make any drastic
17:56
changes though you might want to swap
17:58
out the display cable and make sure that
18:00
it's not related to any connectivity
18:02
between the computer and the display And
18:05
if you have a separate video adapter you
18:07
might want to try replacing that adapter
18:09
and see if the problem disappears And it
