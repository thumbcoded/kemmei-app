0:01
when you're troubleshooting a network
0:03
problem there are a series of steps that
0:05
can give you a baseline of what might be
0:08
working and what might not be working
0:10
The first thing you might want to check
0:12
is to see if you have a link light This
0:14
is a light that's on the Ethernet
0:16
connection that you're using So this
0:18
would be for a wired connection to the
0:21
network If you're plugged in and you see
0:23
a light then you're at least
0:24
communicating and sending a signal to
0:26
the device that's on the other end If
0:29
you don't see a light then you might not
0:30
have a good connection or you might have
0:32
a bad cable You then might want to ping
0:34
the loop back address of the device that
0:36
you're using So you would simply ping
0:40
127.0.0.1 and see if you get a response
0:42
back It may seem odd that you're pinging
0:45
a device that you're physically sitting
0:47
in front of but this is really checking
0:49
to see if the IP stack that's in your
0:51
system is operating normally If there's
0:54
any problem with the internal network
0:56
configuration of your operating system
0:59
then you will not receive a ping back
1:01
from this loop back address From there
1:03
you might want to ping your local IP
1:05
address This would be the IP address
1:07
that was assigned to your device from a
1:09
DHCP server or perhaps it's an address
1:11
that you configured manually In either
1:14
case you should ping that IP address to
1:16
see if you get a response This would
1:18
verify that you indeed have a link light
1:21
and you are connected to the rest of the
1:23
network Now let's try pinging a device
1:25
that is somewhere else on our local
1:27
network And since most local networks
1:29
have a default gateway that's a perfect
1:31
IP address to try So check the IP
1:34
address configuration of your computer
1:36
where it says default gateway and try
1:38
pinging that IP address That will at
1:41
least confirm that you're able to ping
1:42
from your device to another device on
1:45
your local network and receive the
1:47
response If all of that is working it's
1:49
time to try pinging a device that is
1:51
outside of your local network If you
1:54
happen to know another IP address that's
1:56
outside of your local network you could
1:58
try that one Or you could try some of
1:59
the more popular addresses on the
2:01
internet such as quad 8 quad 9 or quad 1
2:06
If you're having intermittent
2:07
connectivity on your wireless network
2:09
then the problem may be associated with
2:11
the channel or the frequencies that
2:13
you're using So you may be able to avoid
2:15
interference from other devices by
2:18
simply changing the configuration of
2:19
your access point Of course our wireless
2:22
connectivity expects that we'll be able
2:24
to send and receive enough signal to be
2:26
able to communicate This means we may
2:28
want to get closer to our access point
2:30
so we have a stronger signal You might
2:33
want to try different antennas on your
2:35
access point to see if you can
2:36
communicate over a wider distance And
2:38
many devices support the ability to plug
2:41
in an external antenna to their laptop
2:43
or desktop computer Many access points
2:46
can evaluate other frequencies that may
2:48
be in use in your area It will then
2:51
automatically choose an access point
2:53
that minimizes any interference with
2:55
other devices You're also able to set
2:57
that channel manually on your access
2:59
point That might be a good way to try
3:01
different frequencies to see which one
3:03
works best for you Some access points
3:06
have problems receiving multiple signals
3:08
that have bounced off of things that may
3:10
be around us We refer to this as
3:12
multipath interference Sometimes flat
3:15
surfaces can cause a problem on wireless
3:17
networks when there's an excessive
3:19
amount of multipath interference And
3:21
sometimes the access point is simply too
3:24
far away By moving that access point to
3:26
a centralized area you're effectively
3:29
increasing the signal strength for
3:30
everyone who's using that access
3:33
point It's obviously difficult to be
3:36
able to see the packets as they're
3:38
moving through the network or going
3:40
across our wireless network For that
3:42
reason when things start to have a
3:44
problem on a computer one of the most
3:46
common complaints is that the network is
3:49
slow In reality the problem might be
3:52
with the CPU or memory inside of their
3:54
local device It could be with the
3:56
application server There might be an
3:58
issue with the database server And it
4:00
may have nothing to do with the network
4:02
But it's up to you as the network
4:03
administrator to determine if the
4:05
problem is on those external devices or
4:07
if the problem really is a network issue
4:10
An easy test would be to perform a ping
4:12
from one end of the network to the other
4:15
and be able to evaluate the response
4:17
times that we're getting back This is
4:19
something you could also validate by
4:20
performing a speed test If you can get
4:23
very good numbers on a speed test across
4:25
the internet then you probably are not
4:27
having a significant network issue You
4:30
then might want to look at every hop
4:32
along the way to determine what type of
4:34
performance you might be seeing So you
4:36
might want to look at network
4:38
utilization on each one of those network
4:40
links Evaluate the number of errors see
4:43
how much throughput you might have
4:44
through each one of those connections
4:46
and then determine if there's any
4:48
filtering firewalling or ACLs that might
4:51
be in place And ultimately you may need
4:53
to take a packet capture from multiple
4:55
points on the network This will give you
4:57
undeniable information on whether the
4:59
slowdown is occurring on the network or
5:01
if it's with the application
5:04
Windows provides ongoing network
5:06
information in the system tray of the
5:08
operating system but occasionally you
5:10
might see an alert that says limited or
5:12
no connectivity or it might say no
5:15
internet access You can start
5:17
troubleshooting this problem by looking
5:18
at the local IP address of your device
5:21
If you've received an IP address from a
5:23
DHCP server or this address was
5:25
configured statically then you should be
5:27
able to communicate outside of your
5:29
local subnet But if there is a problem
5:31
with the DHCP server you may have
5:33
received an automatic private IP address
5:36
That is an AP IPA address This is one
5:40
that will only have local connectivity
5:42
on your subnet and you will not be able
5:44
to communicate outside of your local
5:46
subnet If that's the case you will
5:48
certainly see a message saying limited
5:50
or no connectivity or a message that
5:52
says no internet access If you do have a
5:55
good IP address then you should try
5:57
communicating outside of your local
5:59
subnet try your local gateway and then
6:01
try pinging a remote IP address that's
6:03
on the other side of that local gateway
6:06
As you move further and further through
6:08
the network you will eventually find a
6:10
place where you're no longer able to
6:12
ping And that should be the point where
6:14
you can apply all of your
6:15
troubleshooting efforts to solve this
6:17
limited or no connectivity
6:19
issue These days we perform a lot of
6:22
real-time communication on our networks
6:24
It might be a real-time conference call
6:26
with video or it may be a voiceover IP
6:29
communication When you're in these video
6:31
calls or you're listening on a phone
6:33
call you're expecting to always be
6:35
receiving information so that you can
6:37
see that the video is changing and you
6:39
can always hear what's happening on the
6:41
other side If you were to lose data
6:43
during the middle of this real-time
6:45
communication you can't rewind that
6:48
communication and go back to what was
6:49
missed you simply lose that information
6:52
and you continue on with your call One
6:55
of the ways that we're able to measure
6:57
how often this data is being transmitted
6:59
through the network is through a metric
7:01
known as jitter Jitter is a measurement
7:04
of how much time exists between
7:07
different data frames that we're
7:08
receiving Hopefully we're able to get a
7:11
consistent amount of data coming through
7:13
the network But if there are significant
7:15
delays between these packets you'll see
7:18
that these jitter numbers begin to
7:19
increase What we're hoping to see is
7:22
over time we will see a consistent
7:25
amount of data being received by our
7:27
workstation and that data is coming in
7:29
at regular intervals There's not
7:31
significant gaps between any one of
7:34
these Therefore these jitter values will
7:36
be relatively small If there's some type
7:39
of network congestion or any errors you
7:41
may find that it is not a consistent
7:43
amount of data that we're receiving We
7:45
might see a group of data and then a
7:48
longer gap between then another grouping
7:50
of data and then a longer gap between
7:52
there and so on In this case there's a
7:55
significant amount of jitter between
7:56
these particular frames and it will
7:58
probably cause our video to freeze or
8:01
our phone call to be very choppy
8:04
These applications are expecting you to
8:06
be able to send data through the network
8:08
and have very low latency as it's moving
8:10
from one part of the network to the
8:12
other Anytime you're running a real-time
8:14
application it will be very demanding
8:16
and you'll know immediately either on
8:18
the screen or listening to the audio
8:20
that you're having problems
8:22
communicating with this real-time
8:24
communication If you're communicating
8:26
across the internet you may want to run
8:27
a speed test This will tell you overall
8:30
how much information you're able to
8:31
transfer over what period of time This
8:34
might help you identify links that may
8:36
be too slow for this real-time
8:38
application With an older installation
8:41
it may be that the equipment simply
8:43
can't handle the demands of these modern
8:45
applications and you may want to
8:47
consider performing a router or switch
8:49
upgrade And if you have a packet capture
8:51
you will have a detailed overview of
8:54
exactly what was going on on that
8:55
network and you'll be able to determine
8:57
if the issue is related to the amount of
8:59
traffic how quickly we're receiving the
9:02
traffic or if the problem may be related
9:04
to something else
9:06
Port flapping is when you have a link
9:08
light on your Ethernet connection and
9:10
then you don't have a link light and
9:12
then you have a link light again and
9:14
then you don't have a link light and
9:16
that interface continues to go up and
9:18
down and up and down Many times this is
9:22
a physical problem and it may be
9:23
associated with the cable that you're
9:25
using By replacing the cable or putting
9:27
on a new connector you may find that
9:29
you're able to resolve this port
9:31
flapping problem The problem could also
9:33
be the physical interface on the switch
9:35
that you're connecting to So if you move
9:37
your Ethernet cable to a different port
9:39
on that switch you'll be able to
9:41
determine if the problem follows the
9:43
cable or if the problem is resolved And
9:46
ultimately you may find that it is
9:48
related to the cable If this is a simple
9:50
patch cable it might be relatively easy
9:52
to swap out or you may need to bring in
9:54
a crew to run a new cable across the
9:56
entire length of the building
9:59
Latency is defined as the delays between
10:02
the
10:03
request and the response Anytime we have
10:07
a measurement of those two we can
10:09
identify how quick or how slow our
10:12
network might be performing There's of
10:14
course going to be some latency on the
10:15
network because we have to send this
10:17
information to another device That
10:19
information has to be received processed
10:21
and then the answer has to be sent back
10:23
Sometimes we can measure that latency in
10:25
micros secondsonds Other times it might
10:28
be measured in seconds or even minutes
10:30
It would be useful to know what the
10:32
response times are during each hop along
10:35
the way This may require you to have
10:37
multiple measurements or to be able to
10:39
have multiple devices all measuring at
10:42
the same time This would allow you to
10:43
look at a packet capture and be able to
10:45
calculate the total response time across
10:47
the network and then how much latency
10:50
might also be included by the
10:51
application itself
10:54
One of the challenges we have with
10:55
wireless networks is there may be other
10:57
devices around us that are creating
10:59
interference Sometimes these are devices
11:01
you weren't really expecting to cause a
11:04
problem with your wireless network For
11:06
example fluorescent lights microwave
11:08
ovens cordless telephones and other high
11:10
power sources can create quite a bit of
11:12
interference that can certainly create
11:14
performance problems on a wireless
11:16
network And sometimes you may have no
11:18
control over this interference
11:20
especially if you're in a building with
11:21
many tenants They may have their own
11:23
wireless networks and their own
11:25
microwave ovens and you may have no
11:27
control over how and when they use those
11:30
devices One way that you can visually
11:32
see how much signal you're receiving and
11:34
how much interference you're receiving
11:36
is by looking at a signal to noise ratio
11:39
Many operating systems can provide you
11:41
with an overview of signal to noise
11:43
ratios and create a graph over time so
11:46
that you can get an idea of just how
11:48
much interference may be in the air
11:49
around you With a signal to noise ratio
11:52
measurement or an SNR we of course want
11:55
to know how much signal we're receiving
11:57
And then we want to compare that to how
11:59
much noise or interference we're getting
12:01
on that same network If we're broadly
12:04
looking at a signal to noise ratio like
12:05
this one we're able to get a breakdown
12:07
of that signal and noise Although we're
12:10
not sure where the noise may be coming
12:12
from we can certainly measure the impact
12:14
it's having on our devices We obviously
12:16
want the signal to noiseise ratio to be
12:19
a very large ratio You certainly don't
12:21
want a one:one relationship between
12:23
signal and noise That means you have
12:25
just as much noise as you do signal
12:28
Ideally you would have much more signal
12:30
and very little noise Here's a graph of
12:33
signal to noise ratio where we see quite
12:35
a bit of noise and then we only have a
12:38
little bit of signal on top of that The
12:40
ratio here is almost a 1 one with this
12:43
particular wireless network What we
12:45
would prefer to see is a little bit of
12:48
noise at the bottom and much more signal
12:50
and someone who's using this network is
12:53
having a much better wireless
12:55
experience Sometimes our problems are
12:58
not associated with the network and in
13:00
many ways not associated with the
13:02
application Instead it might be that we
13:04
don't have permission to access the
13:06
resources that we're trying to access In
13:09
those cases we might have an
13:10
authentication issue where we need to
13:12
provide our username our password and
13:15
any other type of authentication factor
13:17
It may be that we authenticated
13:19
previously to that resource but now that
13:21
authentication is timed out and now we
13:23
need to refresh that connection to be
13:25
able to log in again Or it may be part
13:28
of a background process where we provide
13:30
a username and password that that
13:32
service will use Because this is running
13:35
in the background we may not see any
13:37
error messages or get any feedback if
13:40
that authentication doesn't work And of
13:42
course a packet capture will show you
13:44
everything about this connection So if
13:46
we see in the packet capture that we
13:48
requested a resource and immediately got
13:50
a denied permission then our problem
13:52
might be related to an authentication
13:55
issue Some of the most difficult network
13:57
problems to troubleshoot are those that
13:59
are intermittent This means sometimes
14:01
the network is working normally and
14:03
other times it isn't To be able to
14:06
properly troubleshoot this we need to be
14:08
looking at the problem when it's
14:10
happening and that may be a challenge if
14:12
it's only happening at certain times of
14:14
the day Some of the things you can do is
14:16
to set an ongoing ping like the one I
14:18
have here where I'm constantly pinging a
14:21
device every second to see the
14:23
connectivity that I'm getting You could
14:25
also run a trace route to a known
14:27
location or run speed tests occasionally
14:29
to see what the performance might be on
14:31
the network If the intermittent problem
14:33
that you're seeing is one that is going
14:35
to a third party then you may have to
14:37
work directly with that third party to
14:38
help troubleshoot where this problem is
14:40
occurring This may add more complexity
14:42
to troubleshooting the problem So you
14:44
want to be sure to have as much
14:46
information as possible to help with the
14:47
troubleshooting process And if you are
14:50
working with a third party you may want
14:51
to check your contract for your service
14:53
level agreement This will give you
14:55
information on what the expectation of
14:57
uptime and availability might be for
14:59
that third party And it might also tell
15:01
you what the response time is for
15:03
getting support
