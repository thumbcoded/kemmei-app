0:02
if you're working on your computer and
0:03
you get a message that says cannot read
0:06
from the source disc or an error message
0:08
that's very similar to this then our
0:10
problem is that we're either not able to
0:12
write to the storage drive or read the
0:14
information that has already been stored
0:16
on the storage drive when this occurs
0:18
you'll often see the drive constantly
0:21
retrying that particular area to see if
0:23
it can finally read the information
0:25
that's stored either on the platters of
0:27
the hard drive or the SSD this type of
0:31
failure could affect only a certain area
0:33
of the storage drive or it may be an
0:35
intermittent type problem whenever it's
0:37
occurring you'll notice that the
0:39
performance of reading and writing from
0:40
the drive becomes very slow because if
0:42
the drive ever runs into this error it
0:45
will constantly try to retry the read or
0:47
the write to that particular area of the
0:50
drive that retry takes time as it tries
0:53
over and over to try to either read that
0:56
data or write information into that area
0:59
of the drive sometimes this is a loud
1:01
clicking noise especially if it's a hard
1:03
drive that we're trying to access
1:05
sometimes you'll hear people refer to
1:07
this as the click of death because once
1:10
your hard drive starts making these
1:11
clicking noises it's very difficult to
1:14
recover any of that
1:16
data these hard drives have platters
1:18
inside that are spinning very rapidly
1:20
often at 5,400 revolutions per minute
1:23
and higher there are also these actuator
1:26
arms that have heads on the end that are
1:27
moving back and forth across those
1:29
platters and those can also have
1:31
physical failures all of these
1:33
components have very high tolerances and
1:35
if any one of them happens to fail it
1:38
often creates a cascade effect with all
1:40
of the other parts of the spinning drive
1:43
you'll also notice that a lot of these
1:45
components are metal so when you do
1:47
start to have a failure you'll start to
1:49
hear clicking noises or grinding noises
1:52
or the sounds of metal on metal this may
1:55
result in getting very poor performance
1:57
as the drive continuously tries to retry
2:00
writing or reading to that drive or you
2:02
may get an error message on the screen
2:04
and no access at all once you start
2:06
having a physical problem with a storage
2:08
drive it can be very difficult to
2:11
recover from that particular problem
2:13
this is one of the reasons that we
2:14
always tell you to make sure that you
2:16
have a very good and recent backup of
2:19
everything that's on your system if you
2:22
do start to hear these noises and you
2:24
haven't gotten a recent backup this is
2:26
your cue to stop what you're doing get a
2:29
backup system and back up as much data
2:31
as possible from that storage drive from
2:33
that point we can start doing a little
2:35
more troubleshooting we might want to
2:37
check for any loose or damaged cables if
2:39
this happens to be a desktop system this
2:41
might be an easy fix where we simply
2:43
receat a cable and we're able to
2:45
communicate properly to that drive we
2:47
should always be aware of any heat
2:49
problems inside of our computer case and
2:51
it could be that our storage drive is
2:53
getting too hot to operate properly you
2:55
might want to check your monitoring
2:56
software on your computer to see what
2:58
type of temperatures we have inside of
3:00
your case and on the storage drive if
3:03
we've recently added new hardware to our
3:05
computer we could have a problem with
3:07
how much power is being provided by the
3:09
power supply so you might want to
3:11
perform an audit of all of the
3:12
components in your system and calculate
3:14
how much power they'll need and then
3:16
compare that to the capabilities of your
3:18
existing power supply if the drive is
3:21
still working you may want to go to the
3:23
manufacturer's website and download a
3:25
set of their recommended diagnostics
3:27
this is a test that you would commonly
3:29
run overnight and you would try reading
3:31
and writing to every single sector on
3:34
that particular drive this would give
3:36
you an idea of whether the problem is
3:37
isolated to a small area of the drive or
3:40
if it is a much widespread problem with
3:42
that particular storage device
3:45
when you boot your system with a bad
3:47
drive you may see messages like drive
3:49
not recognized or boot device not found
3:53
sometimes there will be lights showing
3:55
you when access to the drive is being
3:57
attempted or if you're seeing no lights
3:59
on your system it could be that the
4:01
drive is completely unresponsive these
4:04
error messages will often be accompanied
4:06
by beeps to let you know that an error
4:08
has occurred and if you are getting
4:09
video on your screen you may also have
4:12
an error message that has more detail if
4:14
you get a message that an operating
4:16
system was not found that means that the
4:19
drive is available and the system is
4:21
able to access that drive but it's
4:23
looked through the file system on that
4:25
drive and is not able to find any
4:26
available bootable operating system if
4:30
our message is that we're not seeing any
4:32
drive at all and we're not seeing any
4:34
access lights on the front of our
4:35
computer then it could be that we have a
4:37
bad cable connection you'll want to try
4:40
receing the power and the data
4:41
connectors for your storage drive and
4:43
see if it's able to see the drive after
4:45
a reboot also check the boot
4:48
configurations in your BIOS you want to
4:49
be sure that the boot sequence is what
4:51
you would expect and you want to be sure
4:53
that your BIOS is not configured to look
4:55
at any removable storage devices to be
4:58
able to boot from those if you have a
5:00
USB flash plugged into an interface your
5:03
system may be trying to boot from the
5:05
USB drive instead of your SSD and if
5:08
this is a brand new storage drive that
5:10
you're using for the very first time you
5:12
may want to double check your cables
5:14
make sure it's getting the proper amount
5:15
of power and that you're accessing that
5:18
drive properly from your system BIOS if
5:20
you have any known good cables that you
5:22
could swap out for the cables you're
5:24
currently using it would be a good way
5:25
to easily check to see if your problem
5:28
is simply related to the cable
5:30
connection instead of the storage drive
5:31
itself and if you think the problem is
5:34
with your motherboard or the SATA
5:36
interfaces on your system you might want
5:38
to remove that drive move it to a
5:40
different computer and see if you see
5:42
the same problem occurring on that
5:44
separate
5:45
system as we mentioned earlier these
5:47
hard drives are mechanical devices and
5:50
because of that the question is not if
5:52
your hard drive is going to fail but
5:54
when is your hard drive going to fail if
5:56
your drive has failed and you need data
5:59
off of that drive sending it to a drive
6:02
recovery service is expensive and time
6:04
consuming if this is an SSD that has
6:07
failed you may find that you're not able
6:09
to write to that SSD but you are often
6:11
able to read the data from that SSD in
6:14
all of these cases the data that's on
6:16
the storage device could be corrupted or
6:18
it may simply be unavailable and
6:20
inaccessible going forward this might
6:23
even be difficult if not impossible to
6:26
recover depending on the type of problem
6:28
this is why we always tell you have a
6:30
backup of your data having a backup can
6:33
solve all of these problems for you and
6:35
you may be able to recover the data in a
6:37
relatively short period of time if
6:40
you're working with a server you
6:42
probably have more than one drive inside
6:44
of that server and very often we've
6:46
configured those drives as a RAID array
6:49
that is a redundant array of inexpensive
6:51
discs any one of the drives that happen
6:54
to be in that array could potentially
6:56
fail it could be that the drive itself
6:58
has failed maybe the drive is not
6:59
receiving enough power and that's the
7:01
reason we can't communicate to it or it
7:03
may not be connected properly or might
7:05
have a bad cable and that might cause a
7:07
communications issue most RAID arrays
7:09
will give you detailed information about
7:11
what's happening with that array
7:14
especially if there's an error so check
7:16
any error messages on the screen or any
7:18
email notifications that might have been
7:20
sent from your RAID controller and very
7:22
often there will be audible alarms to
7:24
let you know that something about these
7:26
drives is not working as expected one of
7:29
the challenges when troubleshooting
7:30
these arrays is that there are often
7:32
many drives to choose from so when
7:35
you're troubleshooting problems with a
7:36
RAID array make sure that you are
7:38
focusing on the correct physical drive
7:40
that is experiencing these issues
7:44
there's often extensive information you
7:46
can gather directly from the RAID
7:47
controller it will tell you which
7:49
volumes are healthy which volumes may
7:51
have a drive that is failed this one
7:53
says that one or more storage pool SSD
7:56
caches are degraded we recommend
7:58
replacing the failing drives with
8:00
healthy ones here's a RAID array with 12
8:04
physical drives and almost all of these
8:06
drives are identical to each other so if
8:09
you are replacing one of the drives in
8:11
this array you want to be sure that you
8:13
really are replacing the bad drive and
8:15
not accidentally replacing a good drive
8:18
when you're working with a RAID array
8:20
that has failed it's important to know
8:22
what type of RAID you're using this RAID
8:25
type will help you understand how to
8:27
reconstruct this array once you replace
8:29
the bad drives if you're running RAID
8:32
zero or striping you need at least two
8:34
drives since this is RAID zero there is
8:37
zero redundancy so if there is a single
8:40
drive failure the entire array is broken
8:43
and you have lost data the only way to
8:45
recover that data is to restore from a
8:48
backup once you've replaced the bad
8:50
drive raid one or mirroring also
8:53
requires a minimum of two drives and as
8:56
long as only one drive has failed the
8:58
array will continue to work normally
9:01
your end users probably won't even know
9:03
there's a problem you simply need to
9:05
replace the bad drive and the RAID array
9:07
will rebuild itself with the information
9:10
that still exists raid 5 is striping
9:13
with the equivalent of one drive being
9:15
parody to be able to use RAID 5 you need
9:18
at least three physical storage drives
9:20
and all but one of those drives needs to
9:22
be operational when you lose one drive
9:25
from a RAID 5 array your array will
9:27
still continue to operate the users will
9:29
still have access to their data and when
9:31
you replace that drive you can
9:33
recynchronize the array to get 100% back
9:36
up and running raid six is also striping
9:40
but it includes the equivalent of two
9:42
separate par drives that means that we
9:45
need at least four drives to be able to
9:47
have a RAID six array and since we have
9:49
the equivalent of two parody drives we
9:52
can lose two individual drives in that
9:54
array and still be up and running just
9:57
as we did with RAID 5 we can replace the
9:59
bad drives recynchronize the array and
10:02
have everything back the way it was
10:04
prior to the failure with RAID 10 or
10:07
RAID 1 + zero we are performing a
10:10
striping and a mirroring of those
10:12
stripes at the same time that means that
10:15
we need at least four drives to be able
10:17
to use RAID 10 and if we lose one of
10:20
those stripe drives we're still up and
10:22
running because we are also mirroring
10:24
those stripe drives that means that we
10:26
could potentially lose one drive from
10:29
each of those mirrors and still be up
10:31
and running so RAID 10 allows us to lose
10:34
everything but one drive from a mirrored
10:37
set of
10:39
stripes most of the drives we use these
10:41
days have technology inside that keeps
10:44
track of many different statistics
10:46
regarding the performance of that drive
10:48
we refer to these statistics as smart
10:51
this is the self-monitoring analysis and
10:54
reporting technology this often uses
10:56
thirdparty utilities to grab these smart
10:59
statistics and provide you with a detail
11:01
of how that drive may be performing you
11:04
could use a thirdparty tool that
11:05
provides you with a breakdown of the
11:07
statistics similar to what you see on
11:09
the screen here this is the raw data
11:11
directly from the smart statistics on
11:13
the drive you would need to know which
11:15
one of these statistics to see such as
11:18
power on hours power cycle count
11:20
temperature Celsius and other metrics
11:23
you might instead want to use thirdparty
11:25
software that analyzes all of this data
11:27
and then provides you with an analysis
11:30
of whether the drive is performing well
11:32
or if there are problems this thirdparty
11:34
software may be able to provide this
11:36
analysis over time so it can perform
11:38
daily checks weekly checks or monthly
11:41
checks to give you an idea of how this
11:43
drive is performing over time and if you
11:45
start to see certain statistics
11:47
degrading over time you might be able to
11:50
replace this drive before it fails
11:52
completely using these smart statistics
11:54
can give you a good idea of the warning
11:57
signs and allow you to prevent the drive
11:59
from having any type of catastrophic
12:01
failure very often a RAID array will
12:04
have this functionality built in but you
12:06
can also have thirdparty software on
12:08
your laptop or portable system that only
12:10
has a single drive inside of it you can
12:13
receive messages on your screen that
12:14
tell you how the performance of these
12:16
drives happens to be and many RAID
12:18
arrays can send email messages or text
12:20
messages so that you can get this
12:22
information even if you're not in the
12:25
console or looking at the console in the
12:27
data center this might be your warning
12:29
to take an extra backup of the data
12:32
that's in that array and you might also
12:34
want to proactively replace any drives
12:36
that are showing any type of
12:38
errors our storage drives are a
12:41
significant component inside of our
12:43
computer and they have a dramatic impact
12:45
on the overall performance of our system
12:48
that's because these drives are sending
12:50
and receiving information from memory
12:52
there's communication across the bus to
12:54
be able to communicate to that device if
12:56
it's a hard drive there's the spinning
12:58
drive access that adds additional delay
13:01
and of course you could be reading or
13:02
writing large amounts of data to the
13:04
storage drive or only a little bit of
13:06
data all of these different processes
13:09
combined to create additional slowdowns
13:11
or delay in accessing your data and any
13:14
problem with any of these steps could
13:16
create significant delay there might
13:19
also be times when we'd like to compare
13:21
the performance of one storage drive
13:23
versus another so you might want to
13:25
perform some performance checks to see
13:27
if you could tell which drive would
13:29
really be the better choice one of the
13:32
metrics that we use to provide that type
13:34
of feedback is the number of input
13:36
output operations per second or IOPS
13:39
this is a very broad view of performance
13:41
and it gives you an idea of the overall
13:44
capabilities of any particular storage
13:46
device to give you an idea of just how
13:49
important these values are let's compare
13:51
a hard drive with an SSD the number of
13:54
input operations per second of a hard
13:56
drive is approximately 200 that's the
13:59
maximum number of operations you would
14:01
see for one of these spinning drives but
14:03
if you replace that hard drive with an
14:06
SSD a solid state drive your IOPS goes
14:09
up to approximately 1 million that is a
14:12
significant difference between the
14:14
spinning hard drive and very often we
14:16
tell people to simply replace their hard
14:19
drive with an SSD and they've
14:21
immediately upgraded their system
14:24
if you boot your system and you notice
14:26
that certain drives are no longer
14:28
accessible from your operating system it
14:31
may be that those have been disabled in
14:33
your BIOS or there was some type of
14:35
error with your BIOS you may want to
14:37
check your BIOS logs or the BIOS
14:39
configuration to see if your system is
14:41
really seeing those drives as being
14:43
accessible if this is an internal drive
14:46
it may just be a loose cable or
14:47
something that may have been
14:48
disconnected so simply receeding those
14:51
cables will usually solve that problem
14:53
if it's an external drive then you want
14:55
to check all the cables going to that
14:57
particular drive and you may want to
14:58
check the drive is receiving power
15:00
through the power connection in some
15:03
cases a user may boot their computer but
15:05
the drive that's missing is not a
15:07
physical drive on their computer but a
15:09
drive that they would normally map
15:11
across the network this is done usually
15:13
during a login process or a login script
15:16
or it may be something the user can do
15:18
manually you might want to look at your
15:20
operating system and see what the status
15:22
is for map drives across the network
15:25
this is the map network drive for
15:26
Windows where you can select what drive
15:28
letter you would like to use the folder
15:30
which in this case is pointing to a
15:32
server called gate room and the share on
15:35
that server is called mission reports
15:37
and you might even want to make sure
15:38
that the check mark says that it will
15:40
reconnect at signin so the next time
15:42
this person boots their machine this
15:44
drive letter will automatically connect
15:46
across the network to the gate room
15:48
server and the mission reports
15:50
share we've been talking during this
15:53
video about the drives that go bad but
15:55
we could have cases where the drive
15:57
controller is going bad we often see
16:00
this if we're using an external drive
16:02
controller which we often do when we're
16:04
configuring a RAID array when you boot
16:06
your system you might see messages like
16:08
this one this one's booting up and
16:10
telling you what different function keys
16:11
you can press it tells you the type of
16:13
processor you're running how much memory
16:15
is in the system there is a boot agent
16:17
for the Ethernet device because you
16:19
could boot across the network and then
16:21
we come to the section that tells us
16:23
about the drive controller it tells us
16:25
that we have a Dell Perk H200 6 GB SAS
16:29
HBA BIOS and that is related to the
16:32
drive controller in this Dell server
16:34
this says there is an integrated RAID
16:36
exception detected and that a volume is
16:39
currently in the state of inactive and
16:41
optimal so you would need to go into the
16:44
configuration utility to provide more
16:46
investigation about why that controller
16:48
is having a problem or why the drive
16:50
connected to the controller is having a
16:53
problem
