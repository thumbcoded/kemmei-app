if you're plugging into an Ethernet
0:04
connection or using a local 802.11
0:07
wireless network then you are
0:08
communicating over a local area network
0:11
or a LAN we usually refer to a LAN as a
0:15
group of networks that are close to our
0:17
location so this might be on the floor
0:20
of a building or in a group of buildings
0:22
that make up this particular local area
0:25
network one of the common
0:26
characteristics of a LAN is that we
0:29
usually get our fastest speeds by a
0:31
local area network if we're connecting
0:33
to networks that are farther away then
0:36
we're probably not on a local area
0:38
network anymore and therefore we're not
0:40
getting those same high
0:42
throughputs if you're connecting to a
0:44
location that's in another city another
0:47
state another country or anywhere around
0:49
the world then you're communicating over
0:51
a wide area network or a WAN because of
0:55
the challenges associated with
0:56
communicating over such long distances
0:59
wide area networks tend to be a bit
1:01
slower than communicating over a LAN
1:03
there also might be many different
1:05
technologies used to be able to
1:07
communicate over this wide area network
1:10
for example you might be communicating
1:11
using pointto-oint serial connections or
1:14
it might be an NLS network or
1:16
multi-protocol label switching network
1:18
and some wide area networks may use
1:20
communication facilities here on Earth
1:22
we refer to these as terrestrial
1:24
networks or we might use satellites to
1:27
communicate across the WAN those would
1:28
be non-aterrestrial
1:31
networks we've also created specialized
1:33
networks for devices and components that
1:36
are close to us as individuals we refer
1:39
to these as a PAN or personal area
1:42
network if you're communicating with
1:44
Bluetooth infrared or near field
1:46
communication you're probably
1:48
communicating over a PAN we might be
1:51
using a personal area network inside of
1:53
our vehicle to have audio output from
1:55
our phone and be able to communicate
1:57
hands-free or it may be integrating with
1:59
the media services that are already on
2:02
your existing mobile device many of the
2:04
wireless headsets that we use these days
2:06
are communicating using Bluetooth that
2:09
certainly would be a personal area
2:10
network protocol and some of the health
2:13
related technologies we use also use a
2:15
personal area network so if you're
2:17
gathering health details on your
2:19
smartphone or you're communicating
2:21
directly to your workout devices then
2:23
you're probably using a personal area
2:26
network we've talked about a local area
2:29
network and we've talked about a wide
2:31
area network but there is a network that
2:33
sits in the middle of those two that
2:35
would be a metropolitan area network or
2:38
a man this is a network that tends to be
2:41
in a single geographical area such as a
2:44
city if we have a lot of remote
2:46
locations around the same city we can
2:48
usually connect to those using a
2:50
metropolitan area network traditionally
2:53
these metropolitan area networks have
2:55
been proprietary but increasingly we've
2:57
seen these standardized on Ethernet
3:00
specifically metro Ethernet which
3:02
describes a type of Ethernet
3:03
connectivity in our local city and you
3:06
might also find that your local
3:07
government has put their own fiber into
3:10
the ground since they do have right of
3:12
way they're able to put anything they
3:14
would like inside of the pipes and they
3:16
can create their own metropolitan area
3:18
network using their own
3:20
fiber many organizations will have a
3:23
repository of storage that they refer to
3:26
as a sand or storage area network this
3:29
is usually a high-speed connectivity
3:32
because we're often transferring large
3:34
amounts of data into and out of that
3:36
sand to the devices accessing the sand
3:39
and this looks and feels like a local
3:41
storage device so you can even take a
3:43
very large file and change a very small
3:45
bit of data within that file very very
3:48
efficiently we refer to this as block
3:50
level access because we're moving so
3:53
much data in and out of the sand we're
3:55
usually putting these on their own
3:57
isolated network connected to the rest
3:59
of the network over very high-speed
4:01
connections
4:03
and in our homes and businesses we often
4:05
will install wireless networks that are
4:08
802.11 technology referred to as WLAN or
4:12
wireless LAN these allow you to move
4:14
around your local area and still have
4:16
access to all of the resources you need
4:19
over your mobile devices your laptops or
4:21
anything else that's using this wireless
4:24
network and if you're working in
4:26
multiple buildings or a larger campus
4:28
area you can add additional access
4:30
points to expand the reach of your
4:32
wireless local area network
