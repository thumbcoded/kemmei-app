0:02
these days you can be almost anywhere on
0:04
Earth and have access to the internet
0:06
we're able to get that access thanks to
0:09
satellite networking where we are
0:10
communicating from Earth to a satellite
0:12
and back down to Earth again since we
0:15
are launching a satellite into space to
0:18
provide this type of connectivity the
0:20
relative cost of satellite networking is
0:22
a bit more expensive than something that
0:24
you might use terrestrially but that
0:26
additional cost does provide a very
0:28
functional connection it's very common
0:30
to see 100 megabits down and five
0:33
megabits up when you're using a
0:35
satellite network connection this is
0:37
perfect for remote sites and places
0:39
where it may not be possible to get a
0:41
traditional form of internet
0:43
connectivity one of the challenges we've
0:46
traditionally had from satellite
0:47
networking is that we have to send this
0:49
signal so far into space and back down
0:52
to Earth again that it adds additional
0:54
latency to the connection traditionally
0:56
we've seen systems have about a quarter
0:59
of a second up and a quarter of a second
1:01
down so there's about half a second
1:03
latency just to be able to send packets
1:05
up to the satellite and back down again
1:07
the newer Starlink connections are a
1:10
little closer to Earth and therefore the
1:12
latency numbers are a bit smaller
1:14
starlink advertises around 25 to 60
1:17
milliseconds of latency but even they're
1:19
working to bring those numbers even
1:21
lower satellite networking isn't without
1:24
its faults of course we have the concern
1:26
of being able to see the satellite so
1:28
our connection between us and that
1:30
satellite needs to be a line of sight we
1:33
might also have connectivity problems if
1:35
a large storm comes through we refer to
1:38
that type of connectivity issue as rain
1:41
fade one of the fastest ways to
1:43
communicate is using light itself
1:45
through fiber optics this allows us to
1:48
send a lot of data through a very small
1:50
fiber making for one of the most
1:52
efficient ways to transmit large amounts
1:54
of data compared to copper fiber is a
1:57
bit more expensive not only for the
2:00
fiber itself but for the equipment that
2:02
connects to the fiber and if you need to
2:04
repair the fiber those costs will be a
2:06
bit more expensive than having to repair
2:08
something that is copperbased but fiber
2:11
does provide us with a way to not only
2:13
transmit large amounts of data we can do
2:15
it over distances that are much longer
2:18
than we can with copper connectivity and
2:21
since we can put so much data over a
2:23
single pair of fiber it's a perfect
2:25
connectivity over long distances for
2:27
your wide area networks so inside of a
2:30
metropolitan area or connecting multiple
2:32
metropolitan areas to each other it's
2:35
very common to see a sonnet ring or some
2:37
type of multi-wavelength fiber
2:40
connection being used to transmit data
2:42
from one place to another it used to be
2:45
that fiber was exclusive to these very
2:47
large wide area networks or inside of a
2:50
large corporate core but these days
2:52
fiber can come directly to our home and
2:54
it's not unusual to see a conversion
2:56
outside of our home to convert from the
2:59
fiber on the street into the copper that
3:01
we use inside of our
3:03
house one of the most common copper
3:05
connections for internet connectivity is
3:08
the cable that you would commonly
3:09
associate with a cable television we're
3:12
also able to run data over that
3:14
connection so it's not unusual to plug
3:16
that into a cable modem and be able to
3:19
access the network through the Ethernet
3:21
connectivity that you would normally
3:22
have inside of your home this cable
3:25
provided by the cable company has a lot
3:28
of different frequencies running on it
3:29
simultaneously we refer to that type of
3:32
technology as broadband we can run
3:34
different frequencies with different
3:36
traffic types all at the same time over
3:39
the same wire this allows us to run many
3:42
different frequencies using different
3:44
services over the same copper wire and
3:46
it makes for a very efficient way to
3:48
provide voice video and data for an
3:51
entire home the standard used for
3:54
sending data over these networks is
3:56
referred to as DOCSIS this is the data
3:59
over cable service interface
4:01
specification there are different Docsis
4:04
versions that provide different levels
4:06
of service and different speeds of
4:08
connectivity on many of these cable
4:10
networks you'll find internet
4:11
connectivity speeds will range between
4:14
50 megabits per second all the way up to
4:16
1 gigabit per second and even higher
4:19
this provides us with extensive data
4:21
connectivity to the internet and since
4:23
we are bringing this in from the cable
4:25
company we can also have television and
4:27
voice communication over that same
4:30
wire many homes also have telephone
4:33
service that's provided by your local
4:35
phone carrier that phone company can
4:37
also add digital data onto that same
4:40
connection that's used for voice
4:42
communication we refer to this as DSL or
4:45
digital subscriber line you'll sometimes
4:48
also hear this referred to as an
4:49
asymmetric digital subscriber line or
4:53
ADSL the reason we refer to this as
4:55
asymmetric is that the download speed is
4:57
often much faster than the upload speed
5:00
for example it's not unusual to find DSL
5:03
connections that may have a 200 megabit
5:05
per second downstream speed but a 20
5:08
megabit pers upstream speed not only do
5:11
we have this difference in speed but
5:12
there's also differences depending on
5:15
how far away we might be from the
5:17
central office the farther away you are
5:19
from the central office the slower these
5:21
speeds will be and DSL tends to require
5:24
that you're about 10,000 ft or closer to
5:27
a central office our cellular networks
5:31
also provide us with internet
5:32
connectivity this technology uses the
5:35
same infrastructure as the one we use
5:37
for our mobile phones where we're
5:39
separating a geography into smaller
5:41
cells and connecting them together with
5:43
antennas some folks might use the mobile
5:45
phone as a jumping off point where they
5:48
will connect their device to the mobile
5:49
phone and the mobile phone then provides
5:52
connectivity to the internet this
5:54
onetoone connection is often referred to
5:56
as tethering if you have a phone that
5:58
provides internet access for multiple
6:01
people simultaneously then you're using
6:03
your phone as a mobile hotspot you may
6:06
want to check with your mobile carrier
6:08
and see if you can get internet
6:09
connectivity through tethering or a
6:11
mobile hotspot and they might also be
6:13
able to tell you if there's an
6:14
additional cost for that
6:17
service in some areas it might be
6:19
difficult to get a copper cable from
6:21
your cable company or even a phone line
6:24
from your local telephone company in
6:26
those situations you might want to use a
6:28
wireless connection to an internet
6:30
service provider or a WISP this is
6:33
perfect for remote locations where you
6:35
wouldn't normally have a connection from
6:37
any other type of internet provider this
6:40
is also very simple to set up because
6:41
all you really need is an antenna and
6:44
you're now connected to the WISP network
6:46
on the wireless network itself you may
6:48
be using a number of different
6:50
technologies it might be a meshed 802.11
6:53
network which is the same kind of 802.11
6:55
network that we use in our homes and
6:57
businesses this might be a 5G home
6:59
internet connection where we're using a
7:02
traditional mobile phone provider as our
7:04
internet service provider and we could
7:07
even be using some other type of
7:09
proprietary wireless connection to be
7:11
able to access the wireless internet
7:14
service provers network we need an
7:16
antenna outside and that usually will
7:18
give us speeds that range anywhere from
7:20
10 to 1,000 megabits per second

0:02
if you're plugging into an Ethernet
0:04
connection or using a local 802.11
0:07
wireless network then you are
0:08
communicating over a local area network
0:11
or a LAN we usually refer to a LAN as a
0:15
group of networks that are close to our
0:17
location so this might be on the floor
0:20
of a building or in a group of buildings
0:22
that make up this particular local area
0:25
network one of the common
0:26
characteristics of a LAN is that we
0:29
usually get our fastest speeds by a
0:31
local area network if we're connecting
0:33
to networks that are farther away then
0:36
we're probably not on a local area
0:38
network anymore and therefore we're not
0:40
getting those same high
0:42
throughputs if you're connecting to a
0:44
location that's in another city another
0:47
state another country or anywhere around
0:49
the world then you're communicating over
0:51
a wide area network or a WAN because of
0:55
the challenges associated with
0:56
communicating over such long distances
0:59
wide area networks tend to be a bit
1:01
slower than communicating over a LAN
1:03
there also might be many different
1:05
technologies used to be able to
1:07
communicate over this wide area network
1:10
for example you might be communicating
1:11
using pointto-oint serial connections or
1:14
it might be an NLS network or
1:16
multi-protocol label switching network
1:18
and some wide area networks may use
1:20
communication facilities here on Earth
1:22
we refer to these as terrestrial
1:24
networks or we might use satellites to
1:27
communicate across the WAN those would
1:28
be non-aterrestrial
1:31
networks we've also created specialized
1:33
networks for devices and components that
1:36
are close to us as individuals we refer
1:39
to these as a PAN or personal area
1:42
network if you're communicating with
1:44
Bluetooth infrared or near field
1:46
communication you're probably
1:48
communicating over a PAN we might be
1:51
using a personal area network inside of
1:53
our vehicle to have audio output from
1:55
our phone and be able to communicate
1:57
hands-free or it may be integrating with
1:59
the media services that are already on
2:02
your existing mobile device many of the
2:04
wireless headsets that we use these days
2:06
are communicating using Bluetooth that
2:09
certainly would be a personal area
2:10
network protocol and some of the health
2:13
related technologies we use also use a
2:15
personal area network so if you're
2:17
gathering health details on your
2:19
smartphone or you're communicating
2:21
directly to your workout devices then
2:23
you're probably using a personal area
2:26
network we've talked about a local area
2:29
network and we've talked about a wide
2:31
area network but there is a network that
2:33
sits in the middle of those two that
2:35
would be a metropolitan area network or
2:38
a man this is a network that tends to be
2:41
in a single geographical area such as a
2:44
city if we have a lot of remote
2:46
locations around the same city we can
2:48
usually connect to those using a
2:50
metropolitan area network traditionally
2:53
these metropolitan area networks have
2:55
been proprietary but increasingly we've
2:57
seen these standardized on Ethernet
3:00
specifically metro Ethernet which
3:02
describes a type of Ethernet
3:03
connectivity in our local city and you
3:06
might also find that your local
3:07
government has put their own fiber into
3:10
the ground since they do have right of
3:12
way they're able to put anything they
3:14
would like inside of the pipes and they
3:16
can create their own metropolitan area
3:18
network using their own
3:20
fiber many organizations will have a
3:23
repository of storage that they refer to
3:26
as a sand or storage area network this
3:29
is usually a high-speed connectivity
3:32
because we're often transferring large
3:34
amounts of data into and out of that
3:36
sand to the devices accessing the sand
3:39
and this looks and feels like a local
3:41
storage device so you can even take a
3:43
very large file and change a very small
3:45
bit of data within that file very very
3:48
efficiently we refer to this as block
3:50
level access because we're moving so
3:53
much data in and out of the sand we're
3:55
usually putting these on their own
3:57
isolated network connected to the rest
3:59
of the network over very high-speed
4:01
connections
4:03
and in our homes and businesses we often
4:05
will install wireless networks that are
4:08
802.11 technology referred to as WLAN or
4:12
wireless LAN these allow you to move
4:14
around your local area and still have
4:16
access to all of the resources you need
4:19
over your mobile devices your laptops or
4:21
anything else that's using this wireless
4:24
network and if you're working in
4:26
multiple buildings or a larger campus
4:28
area you can add additional access
4:30
points to expand the reach of your
4:32
wireless local area network
