0:02
many of us have used our fingers to be
0:04
able to manipulate the screen of our
0:06
mobile phones or our tablets but if you
0:09
need a more precise input method you
0:11
might want to use a stylus this digital
0:14
Stylus is like using a pencil or a pen
0:17
and you're able to get very granular and
0:19
fine control of that information on the
0:21
screen the stylus is usually connecting
0:24
to the device over Bluetooth so it's
0:26
wireless and you're often able to use
0:28
pressure sensitivity and the but buttons
0:30
on the device to enable different
0:32
functions you do have to make sure that
0:34
the stylus you're using is compatible
0:36
with the device you're connecting to so
0:38
if you're using an Apple laptop you have
0:40
to make sure that you're using the apple
0:42
pencil or something that is compatible
0:44
with that particular tablet this pairing
0:47
usually creates in the best possible
0:49
connection and enables the most number
0:51
of features for the person using that
0:53
tablet instead of holding your mobile
0:55
phone to your ear to be able to
0:57
communicate many people prefer to use a
0:59
handsfree headset this headset allows
1:01
you to hear and to talk into a
1:03
microphone so it makes it very easy to
1:05
have these phone conversations you might
1:08
use a wired headset many devices use USB
1:11
as a common headset type or you may use
1:13
the older analog connection over a trrs
1:17
connector this is a tip ring ring sleeve
1:20
connector it's commonly a 32 mm style
1:23
connector you might also hear this
1:25
referred to as an analog audio jack if
1:28
you're using an older model model of an
1:30
Apple iPhone instead of using USB you
1:32
may need to use lightning and there are
1:34
wired headsets available that have
1:36
lightning connectors at the end and of
1:39
course there are many options for
1:40
wireless headsets and most of those
1:42
headsets connect to your mobile device
1:44
using Bluetooth here's a closeup of that
1:47
analog audio jack or
1:49
trrs the trrs stands for tip ring ring
1:53
sleeve where the tip is the connection
1:55
that's on the tip of that connector and
1:58
the sleeve is the connector closest to
2:00
the back sleeve of the connector and
2:02
with a trrs there are two connectors in
2:05
the middle and these are both the ring
2:07
connectors wireless headsets of course
2:09
do not need any type of wires so you
2:12
might have something very simple that is
2:13
battery powered and connected to your
2:15
mobile device over Bluetooth if you use
2:17
that wireless headset all day you may
2:19
find that you run out of battery and you
2:21
might have to shift over to the wired
2:23
version of that
2:25
headset if you like to listen to music
2:27
on your mobile phone you may find that
2:29
the speakers on the phone don't provide
2:31
much Fidelity if that's the case for you
2:33
you might want to use wireless speakers
2:35
which provide a better sound over this
2:37
battery powered and portable speaker
2:39
system these are usually connected to
2:41
your mobile device wirelessly using
2:43
Bluetooth which allows you to take this
2:45
sound and move it anywhere you would
2:47
like within the range of that mobile
2:49
phone many of our phones and tablets
2:52
already include a camera or webcam built
2:55
into the device itself and many of our
2:57
laptops also provide that functionality
3:00
if you have a desktop or laptop that
3:02
does not have a camera or a webcam there
3:04
are options to include external
3:06
thirdparty cameras into that device
3:09
those will often connect to those
3:10
devices over a USB connection once you
3:13
connect the camera or enable it on your
3:15
mobile device you're now able to use it
3:17
in the applications so this might be for
3:19
simply capturing audio and video or you
3:22
might use it with an application to
3:24
provide video and audio
3:26
conferencing if you work in an office
3:28
and you like to take your lap laptop
3:30
home at night you may find yourself
3:31
unplugging all of the wires every day to
3:34
be able to take the laptop home and then
3:36
when you come back to the office you
3:37
have to plug all of those wires back in
3:39
again these would be wires for your
3:41
Video Connection your mouse your
3:43
keyboard perhaps your network link and
3:45
anything else that needs to be
3:47
physically connected there are easier
3:50
ways to perform that function using a
3:52
docking station docking stations are a
3:54
quick way to connect and disconnect the
3:56
laptop without having to touch any of
3:58
the cables that might on that desk they
4:01
also often provide additional interface
4:03
options and you might even be able to
4:05
plug in full-size interface Cards into
4:08
the docking station here's a docking
4:10
station that's in our office you can see
4:12
that we have a monitor and a keyboard
4:14
and a mouse probably have a network
4:16
connection on the back of this docking
4:18
station and we can simply bring our
4:19
laptop in place it on top of the docking
4:21
station and immediately start working at
4:24
the end of the day when we're ready to
4:25
leave we simply disconnect it from the
4:27
docking station and leave all of the
4:29
wires in place if you don't need support
4:32
for additional adapter cards and you
4:34
want something that's a bit more
4:35
portable you might want to use a port
4:38
replicator these are very similar to a
4:40
docking station but instead of getting a
4:42
very specific docking station for a
4:44
specific laptop these Port replicators
4:47
are commonly connecting over a USB
4:49
connection making it something that you
4:51
can use on almost any laptop or desktop
4:53
computer these are also relatively
4:55
portable because you don't have to worry
4:57
about them being very large and
4:59
supporting those adapter cards this port
5:01
replicator includes a lot of different
5:03
connectors including USB connections and
5:05
audio this one also supports micro SD
5:07
and SD card reader built into the port
5:10
replicator itself and on the other side
5:12
we have additional USB and video output
5:15
options as well if you're using a laptop
5:18
in a confined space you may find it
5:20
difficult to use an external Mouse for
5:22
that reason many Mouse functions are
5:24
built into today's laptops using a
5:27
trackpad the trackpad is usually large
5:29
area on the laptop that allows you to
5:31
use your fingers to be able to move the
5:33
mouse around without having an external
5:35
mouse that takes up even more room if
5:37
you like using the trackpad on your
5:39
laptop you can also use a trackpad on
5:41
your desktop with an external trackpad
5:44
these are usually battery powered and
5:45
they connect to your computer over a
5:47
Bluetooth connection unlike a
5:49
traditional Mouse a trackpad can provide
5:51
you with other features that perhaps a
5:54
mouse might not be able to do very
5:55
easily for example you can use different
5:58
finger options on the TR trackpad to
6:01
expand or contract different things on
6:02
the screen which would be relatively
6:05
difficult to do using a traditional
6:07
Mouse many laptops will allow you to
6:10
disable that trackpad using a function
6:12
key on this laptop you can use a
6:14
function F10 that you can see here with
6:17
the blue icon and that will enable or
6:19
disable the use of that trackpad that
6:22
way you can continue to use the keyboard
6:24
and know that you're not accidentally
6:26
going to click anything on the screen
6:27
from the trackpad
6:29
if you like using a stylus on your
6:31
tablet then you might want to use that
6:33
same technology on your laptop or
6:35
desktop computer and you can do that by
6:37
using a drawing pad this is an external
6:40
digitizer that has its own stylus to
6:43
give you the same precise input on a
6:45
desktop or laptop computer that you
6:47
might have on that tablet device this is
6:50
usually a third-party device that
6:51
connects to your computer over Bluetooth
6:54
or USB connection and allows for very
6:56
precise input so if you're someone who
6:59
enjoys using a stylus or you need it to
7:01
provide some type of artistic input this
7:03
might be a good solution for your laptop
7:05
or your desktop computer
