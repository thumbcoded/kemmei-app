0:02
with every person you know and everyone
0:04
in your organization walking around with
0:06
a phone a tablet or even both of those
0:09
we need to have different ways to be
0:10
able to connect these devices back to
0:13
the computers and networks that we
0:15
normally use and of course it seems that
0:17
each device has a different way of
0:19
connecting and communicating back to
0:21
your computer in this video we'll look
0:23
at wired connectivity Wireless
0:25
connectivity and all of the different
0:27
standards and options that you might
0:28
have available on today's mobile devices
0:31
you'll find that these connections that
0:33
we use for these mobile devices are used
0:35
for more than simply charging the
0:37
battery we often might use them for
0:39
connectivity and synchronization of the
0:41
data on these devices you might want to
0:43
back up what's on that device or use it
0:46
as a way to identify that the device is
0:48
really
0:49
yours one of the most common ways to
0:51
connect these mobile devices is using
0:54
USB or the universal serial bus these
0:57
are standard connections that we've used
0:59
for years and years and of course the
1:01
connectors themselves have changed a bit
1:03
as time has gone on you'll find that
1:06
there are different types of connections
1:08
for USB for older devices you may find
1:10
the mini and micro USB plugs are very
1:13
popular these were certainly used on
1:15
older mobile devices but you may find
1:18
even devices in use today are still
1:20
using these very specific USB types you
1:23
may find of course that our mobile
1:24
devices are getting smaller and smaller
1:27
but these interfaces are made for a much
1:29
larger style of interface and although
1:32
many of our modern devices have migrated
1:34
away from the micro b plug or the mini B
1:37
plug you may still use the USB type a
1:40
connection to plug into your Computing
1:42
device like your desktop computer or
1:44
your laptop computer more modern devices
1:47
are still using the universal serial bus
1:50
but they're using a newer version
1:51
referred to as
1:53
USBC this describes this physical
1:55
connection of a USBC plug inside of this
1:58
connection are 24 pins and they have the
2:02
same style of connection regardless of
2:04
how you might plug it in this can easily
2:06
replace the older USB 2.0 connection all
2:10
the way up to the latest standard of USB
2:13
and we can even put different types of
2:15
signals on this wire even though they
2:17
are all using the same type of connector
2:19
as its physical interface for example
2:22
you might find that this USB connection
2:24
is used for more than just serial
2:26
connectivity you could see display port
2:28
HDMI and Thunderbolt all can use that
2:31
single connector to be able to transmit
2:33
video data and other information USBC
2:37
was designed to be a connector that's
2:39
easy to use because you can plug it in
2:41
in any orientation and it also supports
2:44
a higher speed than the older USB style
2:46
connectors that we used to
2:48
use if you're using an older mobile
2:50
device used by Apple you may not be
2:52
using a USB connection you may instead
2:55
be using a proprietary connection from
2:57
Apple known as a lightning connector
3:00
this lightning connector has eight pins
3:02
and it's commonly used for older iPhone
3:04
and iPad devices lightning was
3:07
introduced to resolve a number of
3:08
problems with the older USB connection
3:11
standard for example it supported a
3:13
higher power output so it could charge
3:15
your phones and your tablets a little
3:16
bit faster it can be inserted either way
3:19
so you don't have to keep moving the
3:20
connector back and forth and up and down
3:22
to try to find the right connection and
3:24
this relatively simple design made it
3:26
easy to be able to use this across many
3:28
different devices the challenge of
3:30
course is that you might be using or
3:32
supporting a number of different mobile
3:34
devices from a number of different
3:36
manufacturers so you may be walking
3:38
around with a lot of different connector
3:39
types and cables inside of your bag just
3:42
to be able to support all of these
3:44
different components this might change
3:46
going forward as we move towards a
3:48
single USBC connector type instead of
3:50
using these many and very different
3:54
connections if you want to communicate
3:56
wirelessly there are also a number of
3:58
options available on your mobile device
3:59
one of those options is NFC or near
4:02
field communication NFC is commonly used
4:05
to transmit a little bit of data over a
4:08
very short connection NFC is often built
4:10
into your phone your tablet and your
4:12
Smartwatch and it's often used as
4:14
payment systems for paying something at
4:16
a point of sale terminal or you might
4:18
use it as identification to be able to
4:20
gain access through a particular door or
4:23
to be able to transfer information from
4:25
one phone to another some organizations
4:28
might have a sensor on on the wall and
4:30
they use NFC in a watch or phone to be
4:33
able to act as an access control so
4:35
instead of walking around with an ID
4:37
card or a separate access card you could
4:39
simply use the phone that you're
4:41
carrying
4:42
anyway if you're using wireless headsets
4:45
or wireless keyboards and mice then
4:47
you're probably using Bluetooth
4:49
Bluetooth allows us to connect devices
4:51
over a high-speed Network at relatively
4:53
short distances often we refer to this
4:56
as a personal area network or a pan this
4:59
is is commonly used for devices that we
5:01
would personally use on that mobile
5:03
device things like tethering your
5:05
smartphone to be able to connect
5:06
wirelessly or using it to connect
5:08
wireless headphones or headsets all of
5:11
these types of Bluetooth Communications
5:13
are designed for the individual although
5:15
it is possible to connect multiple
5:17
phones and devices together using this
5:19
Bluetooth networking
5:21
technology another useful mobile
5:23
connection type is to use your mobile
5:25
phone as an internet router if we have
5:28
many people connecting to our mobile
5:30
phone for internet access we refer to
5:32
that as a hotspot if we simply have one
5:35
device that is connecting to this mobile
5:37
phone and that is the only device that's
5:38
able to use that phone we often refer to
5:41
that as tethering this is functionality
5:43
that's commonly associated with the
5:45
software in your phone and the
5:47
capabilities from your phone provider so
5:49
you may want to contact your mobile
5:51
provider for your telephone and find out
5:53
if a hotspot functionality is something
5:55
that you can use on your mobile device
