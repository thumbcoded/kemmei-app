if you have an organization and you need
0:03
to manage all of the mobile phones used
0:06
in the organization then you need a
0:08
mobile device manager or MDM this allows
0:12
you to manage devices that may be owned
0:14
by your company or devices that are
0:16
personally owned this would be a b yod
0:19
where someone is bringing their own
0:21
device to use at work when that occurs
0:24
you need some way to be able to
0:26
centrally manage all of your mobile
0:28
devices from one place this is a
0:31
relatively specialized function and so
0:33
you need specialized software to be able
0:35
to do this an MDM allows you as the
0:37
system administrator to set certain
0:39
rules and parameters on how these mobile
0:41
devices are used so you could set
0:43
policies on which applications are
0:45
allowed or not allowed you can configure
0:48
or disable functionality of things like
0:50
your camera or GPS and effectively
0:53
control almost every aspect of these
0:56
mobile devices this also allows you as a
0:59
company to set up a partitioned area on
1:02
someone's personal phone for use by the
1:05
organization this allows your users to
1:07
have their own private data that is
1:09
protected and private to them and have a
1:11
different part of the phone that is
1:13
partitioned off just for corporate data
1:16
and from a security perspective you can
1:18
require the use of certain security
1:20
policies for example you may require
1:22
everyone in your organization to use
1:24
screen locks and those screen locks need
1:26
to have a personal identification number
1:28
or other type of access in order to
1:31
unlock that phone BYOD is a interesting
1:35
challenge for organizations this of
1:37
course stands for bring your own device
1:39
you may see this also referred to as
1:41
bring your own technology the employee
1:44
owns the phone and since they already
1:46
have a phone that simplifies things for
1:48
the employee so that they don't have to
1:49
carry around two different mobile
1:51
devices but we need to have some way to
1:54
protect the company data that is stored
1:56
in that phone and to make sure that all
1:58
the users personal information remains
2:00
personal and private this allows you to
2:03
configure from the mobile device manager
2:05
what part of that device is home or
2:07
private and what part of that device is
2:09
used for work purposes you can also set
2:12
different parameters for how the data is
2:14
protected on that device and you also
2:16
need to set policies on what happens to
2:18
the data on that device if the phone is
2:21
upgraded traded in or if the phone is
2:24
lost some organizations don't allow user
2:27
phones to be used inside of the company
2:30
instead the company will provide the
2:32
phones through cope this is corporate
2:34
owned personally enabled the company
2:38
purchases the phone they assign that
2:40
phone to a user and then they manage
2:42
that as a corporate device although the
2:44
corporation does have full control of
2:46
that device in many organizations they
2:48
allow the user to use it as a personal
2:51
device as well since the company is
2:53
purchased the phone they have complete
2:55
control over the phone and they manage
2:57
every aspect of how that particular
2:59
device managed this is very similar to
3:02
how organizations might manage laptops
3:04
desktops and other Computing devices the
3:07
company determines how information is
3:09
stored on the device what type of
3:11
information is stored on the device or
3:13
perhaps more importantly what happens to
3:15
that data if the device is changed out
3:18
or if the device is lost some
3:20
organizations will add some flexibility
3:22
to the process and allow the user to
3:25
choose from a selection of devices we
3:28
refer to that as CYO or choose your own
3:32
device having management of all of your
3:34
mobile devices from a central MDM policy
3:37
screen provides a lot of flexibility and
3:40
saves a lot of time for example you can
3:42
configure your Corporate email settings
3:44
on the mobile device manager that's
3:46
pushed down to everyone's phone and so
3:49
they don't have to make any changes at
3:51
all to gain access to their inbox they
3:53
simply turn on their phone and
3:55
everything works as it should the
3:57
security team may decide that they would
3:59
like additional Security on these mobile
4:01
devices since they are outside of the
4:03
company and can be lost easily so they
4:05
may require things like two-factor
4:07
authentication and they can specify what
4:10
type of multiactor authentication they
4:12
would like and from the MDM you can
4:14
determine what applications are allowed
4:17
on that device if there are certain
4:18
applications that are forbidden to be
4:20
installed on that device and you can
4:22
even push those applications to be
4:24
installed
4:26
automatically here's a view from an MDM
4:28
console we can see that we are looking
4:30
at a number of devices inside of the
4:32
organization we can see the device name
4:35
the platform that it uses we can see
4:37
usernames associated with that phone and
4:39
even know the email and contact
4:41
information for the phone and if you
4:43
need the IMI which is a unique
4:46
identifier that's also listed in the
4:48
mobile device manager you can drill down
4:51
on one of those devices to get more
4:52
information about it for example this is
4:54
an Apple iOS device specifically an
4:57
iPhone 13 you can see the version of I
4:59
OS that's being used we also have
5:01
information about the operating system
5:03
running on that device different device
5:05
Security Options that may be enabled or
5:07
disabled and you can see the network
5:09
summary that's currently in use for that
5:11
particular unit if we click over on the
5:13
restrictions tab you can see all of the
5:16
settings that you can enable or disable
5:19
since you are the manager of this
5:21
particular phone you can enable or
5:23
disable the camera FaceTime you can
5:25
change if voice dialing is enabled or
5:27
disabled if you want to get rid of Siri
5:30
you can turn that off inside of the MDM
5:32
and different Security Options printing
5:34
options and application options are also
5:37
configured from this restriction
5:40
screen the MDM also allows you to
5:43
configure how this device will be
5:44
synchronized over the air since these
5:46
devices are rarely plugged into a
5:49
central facility we need some way to
5:51
back up the data that's being stored on
5:53
these mobile phones some of these
5:55
settings are already preconfigured for
5:57
example your telephone information and
5:59
message mesages is something that we
6:00
know will always be configured and set
6:03
up on these devices but different
6:05
organizations might use different types
6:07
of email one organization might use
6:09
Gmail another organization might use
6:11
Microsoft Outlook each organization does
6:14
things a different way with different
6:16
settings and so the MDM allows you to
6:18
have all of those configured in one
6:20
central place it also allows you to turn
6:22
on how the data will be synchronized you
6:25
can specify whether data will be
6:27
synchronized over the Wi-Fi network only
6:29
or if it will use the cellular network
6:31
as well this is also important for
6:33
understanding how this data will also be
6:35
restored if this device fails is damaged
6:38
or you need to replace it you can also
6:41
get into the granular settings of the
6:43
synchronization for example you can
6:45
specify what specific types of data will
6:48
be synchronized will we synchronize
6:50
calendar settings will we synchronize
6:52
contact details and we may want to even
6:54
change how the data is going to be
6:56
synchronized at different times of the
6:59
day for example some organizations may
7:01
not want to use the cellular network due
7:03
to cost limitations maybe you can only
7:06
synchronize this data if it's on an
7:08
802.11 or local network fortunately most
7:12
of our mobile devices have settings
7:14
where we can specify how much of this
7:16
cellular network can be used and for
7:18
what purposes you want to check with the
7:20
contract that you have with your
7:22
cellular provider to see how much data
7:24
would be allowed over this network and
7:27
at what particular time and you as the
7:29
the administrator could configure for
7:31
example if automatic downloads are
7:33
configured and if they are configured
7:35
what size applications can be downloaded
7:38
over the mobile
7:39
network when you're setting up business
7:42
applications on these devices you're
7:44
often configuring things like Outlook
7:46
email cloud storage and other services
7:49
you would commonly set those up in the
7:51
account setting of that device where you
7:53
would need to provide a username a
7:56
password or some other type of
7:58
authentication Factor from there you can
8:00
get even more granular control over
8:02
exactly what will be synchronized and
8:04
you can choose mail contacts calendars
8:07
reminders notes or other settings you
8:09
can also set this up to be different
8:11
from other services so your
8:13
synchronization settings for Microsoft
8:15
Exchange might be very different than
8:17
the synchronizations that you configure
8:19
for Google Mail
