0:02
you have a mobile phone you probably
0:03
also refer to it as your cell phone that
0:06
term cell comes from the cellular
0:08
networks that we use to be able to
0:10
communicate using these phones these
0:13
operate by having antennas that separate
0:16
areas of the land into what we're
0:18
calling cells they're antennas that
0:20
allow us coverage inside of those cells
0:23
using a number of different frequencies
0:25
and all of that together makes up our
0:27
cellular networks these cellular
0:30
networks provide both voice and data
0:32
communication and you get to decide how
0:35
that information is used by your mobile
0:36
device for example you can turn on and
0:39
off the cellular data functionality and
0:41
perhaps only use this as voice
0:44
communication or you may be familiar
0:46
with airplane mode that disables all of
0:48
the communication on this device and
0:50
then you can pick and choose which ones
0:52
you'd like to turn on
0:54
cellular technology really started
0:56
taking off with 3G technology in 1998 3g
1:00
allowed us to send and receive larger
1:03
amounts of data over these networks
1:05
which means that we were able to
1:07
increase the capabilities of our mobile
1:09
devices this allowed us to have GPS
1:11
functionality which we'll talk more
1:13
about in a moment we have mobile
1:14
television video on demand video
1:16
conferencing and other data related
1:19
services all enabled thanks to 3G we
1:22
then upgraded from 3G into the 4G
1:25
technologies sometimes we refer to these
1:27
as long-term evolution or LTE 4g is
1:32
based on a technology called GSM which
1:34
is the global system for mobile
1:36
communications sometimes you may hear
1:38
this referred to as edge or the enhanced
1:40
data rates for GSM evolution this
1:43
allowed us to have bandwidths up to 150
1:46
megabits per second so we were able to
1:48
take those data capabilities in 3G and
1:51
expand on them with 4G we were then able
1:54
to upgrade LTE to LTE advanced or LTEA
1:59
that standard allowed throughputs of up
2:01
to 300 megabits per second greatly
2:04
increasing the amount of data we could
2:05
send over these networks and our modern
2:08
mobile networks use our fifth generation
2:11
of networking or 5G 5g was introduced in
2:15
2020 and it greatly improved the
2:17
bandwidth that we were able to push over
2:19
these networks this 5G technology over
2:21
higher frequencies is designed to
2:23
support up to 10 Gbits per second and if
2:26
you're running over other frequencies
2:28
with 5G you could have 100 to 900
2:30
megabits per second of total throughput
2:33
having that much bandwidth available for
2:35
a single device changes how we're able
2:37
to use these devices for example
2:39
Internet of Things or IoT now allows
2:43
much more functionality because we're
2:45
not constrained by the amount of
2:46
bandwidth that we could send so we're
2:48
able to take these Internet of Things
2:50
devices over these 5G networks and
2:53
instantly send large amounts of data
2:55
over these wireless networks this allows
2:57
us to get notifications faster we can
3:00
transmit and receive much more data
3:02
which allows us to send a lot more into
3:04
the cloud for
3:05
processing just as our cellular
3:08
technologies have increased in speed and
3:10
function we have also had similar
3:12
increases with 802.11 wireless these are
3:16
high-speed 802.11 networks that we
3:18
commonly use at home and in our offices
3:21
this allows us to have very high-speed
3:23
throughput without any type of wired
3:26
connection these do have a limited range
3:28
however and we have a local access point
3:30
that everyone connects to to be able to
3:32
gain access to the 802.11 network this
3:35
Wi-Fi functionality enables voice video
3:38
data and almost any other type of data
3:41
transfer this 802.11 network provides
3:44
functionality for many different types
3:46
of applications and many mobile phones
3:48
allow you to communicate voice
3:50
communication over the 802.11 network so
3:54
if you're in an area where your 4G or 5G
3:57
network doesn't have very good signal
3:59
you could use that phone over your Wi-Fi
4:02
network this allows you to receive and
4:04
send calls just as if you were connected
4:06
to a 4G or 5G
4:09
network we can also turn our mobile
4:11
phones into an internet router and have
4:13
multiple devices use our phone for
4:16
internet access we refer to this as
4:18
hotspot functionality our phone is
4:20
connecting to the cellular network using
4:22
5G and then other devices are connecting
4:25
to our phone over 802.11 this means that
4:28
you can take your phone anywhere and
4:30
have everyone use your phone for
4:32
internet access this is something that
4:34
is commonly built into the operating
4:37
systems and functionality of our
4:39
existing mobile phones but it does
4:41
require that your carrier enable or
4:43
allow that functionality not all
4:45
carriers do and sometimes there's an
4:48
extra charge so make sure you check with
4:50
your mobile carrier to see what options
4:52
might be available for you one way that
4:54
your mobile carrier is able to recognize
4:57
your mobile device is through the use of
4:59
a subscriber identity module or a SIM
5:02
this is sometimes a physical card that's
5:05
inside of your mobile phone and it
5:07
contains all of the information that
5:09
identifies what your phone is on that
5:11
mobile network this means that you could
5:13
potentially take that SIM out of your
5:15
phone put it in a different phone and
5:18
now you've moved your number to a
5:20
different physical device that SIM
5:22
contains information about the carrier
5:24
that you're using and the subscriber
5:26
which is you the user of the phone it
5:28
has a SIM ID and a phone number
5:30
associated with it it contains the
5:32
information about that cellular network
5:34
that you're connected to and there's
5:36
storage space on the SIM itself that
5:38
allows you to store contacts and
5:39
messages on the SIM so when you move the
5:42
SIM from one phone to another you can
5:44
also move those contacts and messages
5:46
newer phones no longer use a physical
5:49
SIM card but instead use an electronic
5:51
version or embedded SIM sometimes you'll
5:54
see this as an eSIM that eSIM is a
5:58
physical part of that phone and can't be
6:00
physically unplugged and plugged into a
6:02
new phone but you can move that SIM
6:05
inside of that device using the software
6:08
on the phone so if you'd like to add or
6:10
move an eSIM into the phone that you're
6:12
using you can choose the option to add
6:15
an eSIM and it gives you then options on
6:17
how you might want to transfer that from
6:19
an existing phone or to use a QR code
6:21
for the transfer having that ESIM makes
6:25
it so much easier to manage that
6:27
transfer between devices if you've ever
6:29
dealt with a SIM which is the physical
6:32
card you can see that they're very small
6:34
you often need a special tool to be able
6:36
to unplug or disconnect those and you
6:38
can see that this phone supports
6:40
multiple SIMs simultaneously so that you
6:42
could have multiple phone numbers or
6:44
profiles on the same mobile phone
6:47
device if you've ever had to connect a
6:49
Bluetooth device such as a headset or an
6:51
external speaker then you know there's a
6:54
process you have to go through to make
6:55
sure that those two devices are paired
6:57
successfully this is not only a process
7:00
that ensures security but it also makes
7:02
sure that you're able to connect to that
7:04
device automatically later on this
7:06
process commonly uses a personal
7:08
identification number or a PIN to verify
7:11
the connectivity when you set it up
7:12
initially and fortunately you only have
7:15
to go through this pairing process one
7:16
time for a piece of hardware once it's
7:19
paired you can connect and disconnect
7:21
from that Bluetooth device and you don't
7:23
have to go through this pairing process
7:24
every single time although the Bluetooth
7:27
pairing process is very similar between
7:29
devices there may be nuances or
7:32
differences depending on the device
7:34
you're connecting to so check your
7:36
documentation to make sure you know the
7:37
appropriate personal identification
7:39
number or where you would find that
7:41
information on your Bluetooth device you
7:44
would start the pairing process by
7:45
enabling Bluetooth on both of the
7:47
devices that will connect to each other
7:49
if you're an iOS or Android user you'll
7:52
find this enable and disable function
7:54
under settings and Bluetooth you would
7:56
then set both of those devices to be
7:59
discoverable by each other this may
8:01
require a specific key sequence or
8:03
startup process so make sure you check
8:06
your Bluetooth device documentation to
8:08
know how to put your device into a
8:10
discoverable mode once you do this
8:12
you'll see devices start to appear on
8:15
your mobile device and then you can
8:17
select that to begin the pairing process
8:19
before the pairing process completes it
8:21
asks you to confirm a personal
8:23
identification number this might be one
8:26
that is embedded into the Bluetooth
8:27
device or it may be dynamic so that it
8:30
changes every time you try to pair with
8:32
that device again your documentation
8:34
will tell you where to find that PIN and
8:36
you'll need to confirm that PIN or type
8:38
it in on one of those Bluetooth devices
8:41
at that point the Bluetooth pairing
8:42
process is complete and those two
8:44
devices can communicate with each other
8:46
you can test this by powering down one
8:48
of those devices powering it back up and
8:50
making sure that it's able to
8:52
automatically reconnect over the
8:54
Bluetooth
8:55
connection if you've ever used the maps
8:57
functionality on your mobile phone then
8:59
you know the GPS capability can be very
9:01
helpful gps is the global positioning
9:04
system and it's a technology that was
9:06
created by the United States Department
9:08
of Defense this technology uses
9:10
satellites that are circling the Earth
9:12
and if you can see four of those
9:14
satellites with your phone then you'll
9:16
get accurate GPS readings this GPS
9:18
functionality uses differences in the
9:21
signal that is received from these
9:22
multiple satellites to determine your
9:25
longitude your latitude and the altitude
9:28
above sea level so if you're using maps
9:30
or you're using an app that has location
9:32
functionality it may be using GPS to
9:35
determine that but GPS is not the only
9:38
way to determine where you are some apps
9:40
use the Wi-Fi networks that are around
9:42
you to get a better idea of where you
9:44
might be even if GPS is not currently
9:47
available and some cellular networks are
9:49
able to triangulate based on the
9:51
different cellular towers to determine
9:53
where you might be as well so if you are
9:55
having a problem communicating or
9:57
receiving GPS signals you may be able to
9:59
use these other technologies to locate
10:02
where you might be
