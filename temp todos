🧠 On deck for tomorrow:
🧲 Preserve dropdown selection after refresh

💨 Fade-out animation on item delete

🔍 Search/filter in Title Manager (right panel)

✏️ Name for the left panel

🎁 Suggested name for the left panel:
Since it’s where users add new cards (title/domain/sub/etc), how about:

🔸 Card Editor (simple, direct)
🔸 Deck Builder (if you lean gamified/study-ish)
🔸 Flashcard Designer
🔸 Content Composer
🔸 Editor Panel (if you just want consistency)

6. Make cog child buttons prettier
1. Get the left panel a separate name
