ðŸ”§ Next Step
Would you like me to now update:

The cert creation form to require both ID and name?

The domain/subdomain forms to only accept name and auto-assign ID?

A small function to suggest the next available domain/subdomain ID?

Also: do you want the editor (the new bottom panel) to reflect this structure for editing existing entries as well?

Letâ€™s lock it in.
