  "answer_options": [
    "DVI-D does not supply power for VGA adapters",
    "DVI-D transmits only digital signals and cannot output analog",
    "VGA cables require a dual-link signal for compatibility",
    "DVI-D is incompatible with any resolution above 800x600"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "DVI-D transmits only digital signals and cannot output analog"
  ],
  "explanation": "DVI-D lacks the analog signal pins necessary to output a VGA-compatible signal, so passive adapters wonâ€™t function.",
