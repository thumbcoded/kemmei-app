  "answer_options": [
    "DSL requires coaxial shielding only supported by RJ11",
    "RJ45 is too narrow to fit the DSL port",
    "RJ11 connectors carry analog signals; RJ45 only supports digital",
    "DSL ports are physically wired for RJ11 pinouts and won’t accept RJ45 plugs"

    "DSL ports are physically wired for RJ11 pinouts and won’t accept RJ45 plugs"
  ],
  "explanation": "RJ11 and RJ45 use different sizes and pinouts. A DSL modem expects RJ11 wiring; plugging in an RJ45 will not align the signal paths properly.",
