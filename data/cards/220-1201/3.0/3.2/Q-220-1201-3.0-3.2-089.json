    "Increased heat in the cable",
    "Short circuits across the block",
    "Signal degradation due to EMI and crosstalk",
    "Mismatched connector polarity"

    "Signal degradation due to EMI and crosstalk"
  ],
  "explanation": "The twist in twisted pair cables minimizes EMI. Untwisting more than half an inch before the punchdown can lead to poor signal performance.",
