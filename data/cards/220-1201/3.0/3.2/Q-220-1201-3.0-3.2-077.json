  "answer_options": [
    "RJ45 signal interference from telephone lines",
    "DOCSIS modems require analog signals which degrade quickly",
    "Signal attenuation can prevent synchronization with the provider",
    "F connector can’t physically support long coax runs"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Signal attenuation can prevent synchronization with the provider"
  ],
  "explanation": "Long coaxial cable runs can cause signal loss (attenuation), potentially disrupting the DOCSIS modem’s ability to sync with the cable provider.",
