  "question_text": "A technician wants to use a legacy Molex connector on a drive designed for SATA power. What issue might occur?",
  "answer_options": [
    "Molex provides only 3.3V, which SATA drives require",
    "The Molex connector has a different pin shape and voltage profile",
    "SATA drives use analog signaling that Molex doesnâ€™t support",
    "Molex cannot provide enough bandwidth for modern drives"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "The Molex connector has a different pin shape and voltage profile"
  ],
  "explanation": "Molex and SATA power connectors deliver different voltages and pinouts. Adapters are required and may not support all features like hot-swap or 3.3V.",
