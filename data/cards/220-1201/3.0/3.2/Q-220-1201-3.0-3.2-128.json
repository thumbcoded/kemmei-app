  "question_text": "Which electrical characteristic of RS232 signaling makes it more vulnerable to noise over long distances?",
  "answer_options": [
    "It uses fiber for transmission",
    "It relies on high-frequency modulation",
    "It uses single-ended signaling with large voltage swings",
    "It is wireless and reflects ambient radio waves"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "It uses single-ended signaling with large voltage swings"
  ],
  "explanation": "RS232 uses single-ended signaling (not differential), making it more susceptible to electrical noise and signal degradation across long runs.",
