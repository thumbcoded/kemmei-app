  "question_text": "How does doubling the number of memory channels affect theoretical memory bandwidth?",
  "answer_options": [
    "It halves the total latency across modules",
    "It increases bandwidth by approximately 25%",
    "It has no effect unless CPU clock speed is also doubled",
    "It doubles the memory bandwidth available to the CPU"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "It doubles the memory bandwidth available to the CPU"
  ],
  "explanation": "Adding memory channels allows the CPU to read/write data to multiple modules simultaneously, effectively doubling available bandwidth in a dual-channel configuration.",
