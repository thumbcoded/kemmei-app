  "question_text": "Why does DDR memory achieve higher effective data rates than single data rate (SDR) memory at the same clock frequency?",
  "answer_options": [
    "DDR uses wider data buses with more pins",
    "DDR transfers data on both rising and falling clock edges",
    "DDR operates at double the voltage of SDR memory",
    "DDR modules contain twice as many memory chips"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "DDR transfers data on both rising and falling clock edges"
  ],
  "explanation": "DDR (Double Data Rate) transfers data twice per clock cycle - once on the rising edge and once on the falling edge - effectively doubling throughput compared to SDR.",
