  "answer_options": [
    "The byte contains 4 ones, which is even",
    "The parity bit should be 1 for even parity",
    "A memory error has likely occurred",
    "The byte is valid with correct even parity",
    "The system should halt and reboot"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "The parity bit should be 1 for even parity",
    "A memory error has likely occurred"
  ],
  "explanation": "The byte has 4 ones (even), so even parity requires a 0 parity bit. But since we expected 1 and got 0, an error has occurred.",
