  "question_text": "What is the key difference between single data rate (SDR) and double data rate (DDR) memory?",
  "answer_options": [
    "DDR uses less voltage than SDR",
    "DDR transfers data on both rising and falling edges of the clock cycle",
    "SDR has more capacity per module",
    "DDR can only be used in servers"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "DDR transfers data on both rising and falling edges of the clock cycle"
  ],
  "explanation": "DDR (Double Data Rate) memory can transfer data on both edges of a clock cycle, effectively doubling the data transfer rate over SDR memory.",
