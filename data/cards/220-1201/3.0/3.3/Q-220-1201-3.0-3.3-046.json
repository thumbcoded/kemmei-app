  "answer_options": [
    "It runs at a lower voltage",
    "It has fewer pins and smaller size",
    "It transfers data on both edges of the clock cycle",
    "It uses cache memory to reduce latency"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "It transfers data on both edges of the clock cycle"
  ],
  "explanation": "DDR (Double Data Rate) memory improves on SDR by transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock cycle, doubling throughput without increasing clock speed.",
