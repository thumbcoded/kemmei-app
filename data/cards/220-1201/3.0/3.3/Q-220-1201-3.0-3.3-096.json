  "question_text": "In a system with quad-channel memory, what happens when the CPU needs to access data stored across all four channels simultaneously?",
  "answer_options": [
    "The CPU waits for each channel to complete sequentially",
    "Only the fastest channel responds to maintain synchronization",
    "All four channels can transfer data in parallel, quadrupling effective bandwidth",
    "The memory controller automatically disables slower channels"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "All four channels can transfer data in parallel, quadrupling effective bandwidth"
  ],
  "explanation": "Multi-channel memory allows parallel data access across multiple channels, significantly increasing memory throughput compared to single-channel operation.",
