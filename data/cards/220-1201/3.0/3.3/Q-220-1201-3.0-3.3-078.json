  "answer_options": [
    "It does not include a parity bit with stored bytes",
    "It only checks for even parity, missing multi-bit errors",
    "It attempts to correct errors instead of halting the system",
    "It is incompatible with ECC systems"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "It only checks for even parity, missing multi-bit errors"
  ],
  "explanation": "Parity memory uses a single parity bit for each byte, allowing detection of some errors but not allâ€”especially if multiple bits are affected.",
