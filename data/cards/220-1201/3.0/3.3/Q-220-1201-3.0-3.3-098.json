  "question_text": "For the byte 01011001, what parity bit calculation would detect if a single bit error occurred during storage or retrieval?",
  "answer_options": [
    "Add a 0 parity bit for even parity",
    "Add a 1 parity bit for even parity",
    "Use two parity bits for double protection",
    "Parity cannot detect single-bit errors"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Add a 0 parity bit for even parity"
  ],
  "explanation": "The byte has 4 ones (even), so a 0 parity bit maintains even parity. If any single bit changes, the parity check will fail and detect the error.",
