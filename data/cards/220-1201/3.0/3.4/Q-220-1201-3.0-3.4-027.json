    "Latency becomes negative above 15000 RPM",
    "The OS cannot handle speeds above 7200 RPM",
    "Mechanical limitations and heat increase faster than performance",
    "High RPM disables error correction features"

    "Mechanical limitations and heat increase faster than performance"
  ],
  "explanation": "Higher RPM reduces latency, but it also increases friction, vibration, and heat, leading to diminishing returns and shorter lifespan.",
