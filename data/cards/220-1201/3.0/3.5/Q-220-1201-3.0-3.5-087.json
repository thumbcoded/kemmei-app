  "question_text": "A technician installs a high-end GPU, but the system randomly crashes under load. The PSU has a 6-pin PCIe connector, but the GPU requires 8-pin. Whatâ€™s the MOST likely cause?",
  "answer_options": [
    "Driver conflict",
    "CPU power draw is too high",
    "Insufficient voltage on the 12V rail",
    "Not enough lanes on the PCIe slot"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Insufficient voltage on the 12V rail"
  ],
  "explanation": "Using a 6-pin connector in place of an 8-pin on a high-power GPU can cause undervoltage under load, leading to instability.",
