  "question_text": "Why is port mirroring not always suitable for capturing all network traffic in forensic investigations?",
  "answer_options": [
    "It uses encrypted VLAN tunnels by default",
    "It strips timestamps from captured packets",
    "It may fail to capture traffic under heavy load or misconfiguration",
    "It converts all traffic to broadcast mode"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "It may fail to capture traffic under heavy load or misconfiguration"
  ],
  "explanation": "Port mirroring is dependent on switch software and can miss packets during high-volume scenarios or due to misconfiguration, making it less reliable for forensic-grade captures.",
