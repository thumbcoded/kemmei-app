  "question_text": "A technician uses a tone generator to locate a cable, but the probe detects a faint signal across multiple adjacent cables. What is the most likely cause?",
  "answer_options": [
    "The generator is injecting a digital signal",
    "The probe's battery is too weak to function",
    "Electromagnetic crosstalk is causing signal bleed",
    "The tone generator was connected to a fiber optic cable"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Electromagnetic crosstalk is causing signal bleed"
  ],
  "explanation": "When several cables are bundled together, signal crosstalk can occur, causing the tone to bleed into nearby wires and making the probe pick up multiple faint signals.",
