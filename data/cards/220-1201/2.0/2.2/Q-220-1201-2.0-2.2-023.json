  "question_text": "Why are only three 20 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band considered non-overlapping in most countries?",
  "answer_options": [
    "The 2.4 GHz band only allows three channels total",
    "All other channels are restricted by licensing",
    "The limited spectrum causes adjacent channels to overlap",
    "Wi-Fi clients can only support three simultaneous streams"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "The limited spectrum causes adjacent channels to overlap"
  ],
  "explanation": "Because the 2.4 GHz band is narrow, most 20 MHz channels overlap with adjacent ones, leaving only channels 1, 6, and 11 non-overlapping in practice.",
