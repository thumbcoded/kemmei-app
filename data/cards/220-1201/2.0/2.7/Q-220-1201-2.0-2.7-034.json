  "answer_options": [
    "DSL signals travel through fiber while cable uses coax",
    "Cable uses symmetric transmission while DSL does not",
    "DSL signal strength weakens over copper phone lines, while cable uses centralized amplification over coax",
    "Cable internet uses Wi-Fi signals over coax which are less susceptible to distance"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "DSL signal strength weakens over copper phone lines, while cable uses centralized amplification over coax"
  ],
  "explanation": "DSL signal strength drops the farther it travels from the central office due to attenuation over copper. Cable networks use amplifiers to maintain signal quality.",
