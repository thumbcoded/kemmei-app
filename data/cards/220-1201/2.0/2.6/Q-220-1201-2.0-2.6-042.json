  "answer_options": [
    "A /30 subnet provides two usable host IPs",
    "The default gateway must fall within the same subnet as the host",
    "Subnet masks determine broadcast addresses",
    "Default gateway IPs must be public addresses",

    "A /30 subnet provides two usable host IPs",

    "Subnet masks determine broadcast addresses",
    "Subnet masks can affect route selection"
  ],
  "explanation": "Only the claim about default gateways requiring public IPs is false. All others are valid: /30 yields 2 usable, subnet masks define boundaries, and they influence routing logic.",
