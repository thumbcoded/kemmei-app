  "question_text": "How does a PoE-capable switch determine whether a connected device should receive power?",
  "answer_options": [
    "It checks the MAC address of the device",
    "It requires manual configuration of power delivery",
    "It performs an initial handshake to detect PoE compatibility",
    "It automatically delivers power to any connected Ethernet device"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "It performs an initial handshake to detect PoE compatibility"
  ],
  "explanation": "PoE-capable switches use a detection mechanism (based on resistive sensing) to confirm that a connected device is PoE-compliant before delivering power, preventing accidental power delivery to unsupported devices.",
