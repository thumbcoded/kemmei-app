  "question_text": "A user is manually configuring their IP but continues to get 'limited connectivity'. They can ping 127.0.0.1 and their IP, but not the gateway. What is the most probable cause?",
  "answer_options": [
    "The IP stack is corrupted",
    "They are using a reserved DHCP IP",

  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Their subnet mask or gateway is misconfigured"
  ],
  "explanation": "The ability to ping loopback and their IP confirms the NIC and stack are working. If the gateway is unreachable and IP is manual, itâ€™s likely a config error in the subnet or gateway fields.",
