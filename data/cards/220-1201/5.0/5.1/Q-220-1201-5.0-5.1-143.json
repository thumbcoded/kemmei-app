  "correct_answer": [
    "CPU, single RAM stick, power supply, basic video - eliminates variables to isolate problems"
  ],
  "explanation": "Minimal configuration includes: CPU, single RAM stick, power supply, and basic video output (integrated or single graphics card). This eliminates variables that could cause problems: multiple RAM sticks, expansion cards, extra drives, and unnecessary peripherals. Effective because it isolates core functionality and makes it easier to identify if problems are motherboard-related or component-related.",
