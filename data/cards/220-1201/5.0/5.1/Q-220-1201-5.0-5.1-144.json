  "question_text": "What are performance issues in the context of hardware troubleshooting and how do you identify them?",
  "answer_options": [
    "Performance issues only relate to software optimization and application efficiency",
    "Slow operation, reduced throughput, thermal throttling - monitor temps, speeds, benchmarks",
    "Performance problems exclusively indicate network connectivity issues",
    "All performance issues require immediate hardware replacement without testing"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Slow operation, reduced throughput, thermal throttling - monitor temps, speeds, benchmarks"
  ],
  "explanation": "Hardware performance issues include: slow operation, reduced throughput, thermal throttling, and component degradation. Identify by: monitoring CPU/GPU temperatures, checking clock speeds, running benchmarks, monitoring resource utilization, checking for dust buildup, and verifying proper cooling operation. Compare results to baseline performance and manufacturer specifications.",
