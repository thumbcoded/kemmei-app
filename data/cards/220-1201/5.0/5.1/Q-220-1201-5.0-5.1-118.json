  "explanation": "A critical error is a severe system fault that requires immediate shutdown to prevent data corruption or hardware damage. It differs from other errors by: causing immediate system halt, preventing normal operation, often triggering blue screen or kernel panic, and typically indicating hardware failure or severe driver issues rather than minor software problems.",
