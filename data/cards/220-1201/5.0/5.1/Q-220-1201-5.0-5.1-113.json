  "correct_answer": [
    "Thin, flat CMOS batteries for compact motherboards in small form factor PCs"
  ],
  "explanation": "Low profile batteries are thin, flat CMOS batteries designed for compact motherboards where space is limited, such as in small form factor PCs, laptops, or embedded systems. They serve the same function as standard coin cell batteries (maintaining BIOS settings and real-time clock) but in a smaller form factor to fit tight spaces.",
