    "Network signal strength measurements for wireless connectivity",
    "Acceptable DC output ranges (±5% for 12V, ±5% for 5V, ±4% for 3.3V) - critical for component stability",

  "correct_answer": [
    "Acceptable DC output ranges (±5% for 12V, ±5% for 5V, ±4% for 3.3V) - critical for component stability"
  ],
  "explanation": "Voltage tolerances define acceptable ranges for DC outputs (typically ±5% for 12V, ±5% for 5V, ±4% for 3.3V). They're important because: components are designed for specific voltages, out-of-tolerance power can damage hardware, cause instability, or prevent proper operation. Test with multimeter to verify PSU outputs fall within acceptable ranges under load.",
