    "Random removal of components without systematic approach",

  "correct_answer": [
    "Systematically remove non-essential components to isolate problems - start with minimal configuration"
  ],
  "explanation": "Process of elimination for motherboards: 1) Start with minimal configuration (CPU, 1 RAM stick, power), 2) Test basic functionality, 3) Add components one at a time, 4) Test after each addition, 5) When problem appears, last added component is suspect, 6) Remove and retest to confirm. This isolates defective components and prevents damage from faulty parts.",
