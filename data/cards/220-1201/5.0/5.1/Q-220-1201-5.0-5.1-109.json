  "question_text": "What are the advantages and considerations when configuring SSD boot in BIOS?",
  "answer_options": [
    "SSDs only work with older BIOS systems and require IDE mode",
    "Faster boot times, improved responsiveness - ensure AHCI mode and TRIM support",
    "SSDs consume more power than traditional drives and need special cooling",
    "SSDs are less reliable than hard drives and should not be used for boot drives"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Faster boot times, improved responsiveness - ensure AHCI mode and TRIM support"
  ],
  "explanation": "SSD boot advantages: significantly faster boot times, improved system responsiveness, lower power consumption, no moving parts (more reliable). Considerations: ensure SATA mode is set to AHCI (not IDE), enable TRIM support, verify boot order prioritizes SSD, and confirm UEFI compatibility for modern SSDs with GPT partitions.",
