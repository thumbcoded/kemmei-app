    "CPU becomes unresponsive, entire system freezes requiring hard reset, differs from crashes or reboots"

  "explanation": "System lock ups occur when the CPU becomes unresponsive and the entire system freezes, requiring a hard reset. They differ from crashes (which show error messages) or reboots (which restart automatically). Lock ups typically indicate: CPU overheating, power supply issues, bad RAM, motherboard problems, or driver conflicts causing kernel-level freezing.",
