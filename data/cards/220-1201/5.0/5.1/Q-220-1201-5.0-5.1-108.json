    "Determines which storage device gets power first during startup",

  "correct_answer": [
    "Determines the order BIOS searches storage devices for bootable operating systems"
  ],
  "explanation": "Storage device priority determines the order in which the BIOS searches storage devices for bootable operating systems. Proper configuration ensures: the correct OS loads first, prevents booting from unwanted devices (like USB drives), reduces boot time, and maintains consistent system behavior. Set primary OS drive as first priority.",
