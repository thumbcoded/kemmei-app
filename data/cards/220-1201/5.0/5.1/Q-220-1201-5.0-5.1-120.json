  "correct_answer": [
    "Repetitive clicking sounds from hard drive indicating severe mechanical failure"
  ],
  "explanation": "The 'click of death' refers to repetitive clicking sounds from a hard drive, indicating severe mechanical failure. It occurs when read/write heads repeatedly try to access data but fail, often due to head crash, platter damage, or actuator failure. This usually means imminent drive failure and immediate data backup is critical before complete failure occurs.",
