  "answer_options": [
    "Capacitor problems only affect audio quality and sound output functions",
    "Bulging caps, leaking electrolyte causing instability, random crashes, power regulation issues",
    "All capacitor issues are cosmetic and don't affect system functionality",
    "Capacitor problems exclusively impact network connectivity and data transfer"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Bulging caps, leaking electrolyte causing instability, random crashes, power regulation issues"
  ],
  "explanation": "Capacitor problems manifest as: bulging or leaking capacitors (visual inspection), power regulation issues, random system crashes, boot failures, and component instability. Failed capacitors cause voltage irregularities that affect connected components. Look for physical signs: bulging tops, leaked electrolyte residue, or discoloration around capacitors on motherboard.",
