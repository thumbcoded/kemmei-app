  "answer_options": [
    "Use any resolution close to the native resolution",
    "Use a multiple of the native resolution for better scaling",
    "Always use the lowest resolution for maximum compatibility",
    "Use the highest possible resolution regardless of scaling"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "Use a multiple of the native resolution for better scaling"
  ],
  "explanation": "If you can't use native resolution, using a multiple (like half or double) provides better scaling results. This allows more predictable pixel mapping and reduces the scaling artifacts that make text and graphics appear fuzzy.",
