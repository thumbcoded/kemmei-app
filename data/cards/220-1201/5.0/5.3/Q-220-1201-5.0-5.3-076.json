  "question_text": "What is pixel shift technology and why do monitors implement it?",
  "answer_options": [
    "A feature that increases monitor resolution by interpolating additional pixels",
    "A slight automatic movement of the image to prevent burn-in by distributing wear across pixels",
    "A manual adjustment that allows users to align the image on their screen",
    "A power-saving feature that dims unused pixels to extend monitor life"
  ],
  "correct_answer": [
    "A slight automatic movement of the image to prevent burn-in by distributing wear across pixels"
  ],
  "explanation": "Pixel shift automatically moves the displayed image by a few pixels periodically when the monitor detects static content. This prevents burn-in/image sticking by ensuring no single pixel displays the same information continuously. The movement is subtle enough to be unnoticed by users.",
